    "Undoubtedly, this was the most challenging part of the assignment. However, I discovered the `Eurostat` website, which provides extensive content on data transportation. Additionally, the `CSO` offers interesting datasets related to the Irish transportation sector. Other platforms utilized included `GitHub`, `Kaggle`, and `TripAdvisor`.\n",

    "A positive aspect of this research is that I discovered platforms such as `Eurostat`, which even has a `Python` package to download its datasets. On the negative side, the length of transportation datasets I found was a challenge for the machine learning part. There was not enough data to create accurate and consistent models. However, I found a solution to overcome this issue.\n",

I am compliant with `GDPR`, and `TripAdvisor` does not state that you cannot collect their reviews for research purposes.\n"
