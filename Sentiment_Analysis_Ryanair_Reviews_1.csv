1,Bad,"Not on time. Not to destination or back home. Get the posibility to freze outside while your getting hold back from bording. Or just wait in line, buisniss is no needed, you get all the waiting for free"
2,Bad,Checkin If you are trying to verify your booking you cannot do it unless you have a up-to-date phone .be cause I had a lot of trouble doing it .in the end I got someone to do for me and thay had trouble to.got it in the end.but you look on another holiday you do not have to do…
3,Bad,Terrible delays. Stealing people's time. 2 hours delay. by the time i get on the plane i would have arrived at my destination with another airline
4,Bad,"The staff members were friendly and there was more leg space than other lower budget airlines. However, the company itself is not very customer friendly. For us we were unable to pay for food and drinks with our bank card."
5,Bad,I took a flight from Italy to Romania and they forced me to pay 60 euros more because my backpack was 5 cm larger than allowed... I understand business is business but this is also a mockery.... would never fly with ryanair ever again
6,Bad,Exhausting flight delayed an hour and a half but put more time on that we are currently standing on a stairs with no information no movement just stuck on a stairs at 11pm waiting. Excruciating...why not leave us sitting if we are just going to be left on a stairway?? Never again
7,Bad,"Priority boarding is a myth, in Luxembourg airport at least. OK, they sort the passengers into priority and non-. The priority passengers have priority into the gate lounge, then the non-priority get into the gate lounge. Then they all get mixed up and you take your chances for…"
8,Bad,I go on ryanair allot but I have to say it is outrageous how unsanitary the plane is and my flight was on 6.30 and it got delayed to nine.their flights are always delayed.
9,Bad,"Only flew with Ryanair on maybe 3 occasions, and every time the flight has been delayed, after there huge profit so far this year, they could at least deliver a spot on service."
10,Bad,"The flight was late and the plane was incredibly untidy (a previous passenger's crisps adorned the floor). On a brighter note, the crew were pleasant enough and the flight was cheap. It would have been nice to not sit in someone else's food though."
11,Bad,Not good airline. The seats are dirty not cleaned. Had to pay over £100 for 10 kg over. Seats are stiff and has no recline or padding. I am absolutely disgusted with this. The only thing that I am pleased with is that the crew are friendly and caring .
12,Bad,"Ryanair almost always starts off late the flight without any reimbursement of course. Their rules are always strict for the client (baggage kilos, late check-in etc) but never for themselves."
13,Bad,Only good thing about Ryanair is that its cheap and the app is user friendly. That is it! I have been flying frequently from Malmo to Zagreb and back. I have expirienced delays 70% of the time. Last flight was overbooked and delayed without notice. Good luck flying Ryanair :)
14,Bad,"Awful service, 2 hour delay and then they preboard and leave you in the jet way for another 30 minutes. They done care as long as they get your money, no apologies nothing."
15,Bad,"Average flight, customer service agent refused to print a pass for me, seemed annoyed to even be asked to do so. He said it was company policy to not to, but after further discussion finally printed one for me. It seems minor but it just came off as can't be bothered to help a customer."
16,Bad,"I went on Ryanair for a holiday, the way there was alright the way back was shocking, Rude staff, not clean, Hard landings. Angry people, horrid, Do NOT fly with this airline"
17,Bad,"Lower fares but planes alwatslaye arriving and departing. Staff average, onboard services average. Disorganised, amateur not very professional."
18,Bad,"We planned a day trip to Santorini. The idea was to maximize the time by flying to the Island in the early morning and depart by the last flight. In both cases, our flights were delayed leading to longer waits at the airport and rescheduling the activities."
19,Bad,"Smallest, cheapest, most uncomfortable flight I ever had. If you are bigger then the average Ethiopian child, you will have a terrible flight for comfort"
20,Bad,"Unhygenic, insects, litter, late flight, long queues waiting on stairs etc, charge extra money for everything, lots of advertising and selling on board"
21,Bad,They made sure if you don't pay for your seat they will make sure they will spilt the family. Otherwise seats are old
22,Bad,We received a message at 6:30 in the evening that we have to get to a city 3.5 hours away for our morning flight back home. We paid 850€ for a taxi and now we really hope to get our money back. Its really funny that they think all Ryanair customers have this much money on their account to spend on a freaking taxi.
23,Bad,"While boarding, the ticket & passport checker guy looked at my passport and asked how old i was, that was ofc acceptable but then after i replied that i was 23, he gave me my passport back and then unnecceseraly commented that i look much younger than 23. Ok, rude????"
24,Bad,Ryanair does not have direct personnel at the Shannon Airport and the people at the checkin counter are limited on their capacity to solve problems and terrified of making decisions.
25,Bad,Feel like I’ve been ripped off for The get go! So sone my booking as last min deal in morning in my phone as had to ring up so so I did that in afternoon as booked hotel then to be told in evening they upped my flights by extra £200 then I had to pay extra £26 just to be seated…
26,Bad,"Ryanair check passengers in and hold them on steps, overcrowded and no seats bad air. Or put them on warm or freezing tarmac. This is done more and more. Regulators should stop the practice"
27,Bad,"The boarding was the the most worse ever, nobody took in account if we had priority or not , people with no priority went in front, and very rood personnel at the boarding gate."
28,Bad,"Poor customer service. If you have a problem, get ready to be played with or chat with a useless bot."
29,Bad,Poor customer service and secretly hidden extra price and cause horrible issues and awfully horrible landings and is the worst airline in the world.
30,Bad,Price of ticket 53 euros. Price for checking in at the counter and not online 62 euros :(. No other comment necessary. Be aware.
31,Bad,The most crap company. Always delayed. Doesn’t matter season or not. They never on time. And never advise you before
32,Bad,"it was terrible!! He kept us on the stairs after checking our tickets for 30 minutes, then on the plane for another hour!! dirt on the floor! very ugly Last time with RyanAir"
33,Bad,"The ryanair planes ALWAYS late. The vienna-rhodes flight was standing about 1,5 hour and late 2hour. Now the rhodes-vienna plane is doing the same."
34,Bad,"Had appr. 20 flights from and to stansted-eindhoven, only 4 have been on time. For me Ryanair is not a reliable airline."
35,Bad,Filthy! Seat had hairs all over it and there were sticky sweets left on the floor and between the seats. The tray was sticky where a drink had been spilt and had run down the seat in front. The window was dirty with mucky finger prints. My luggage bag was dirty after having to stow it under the seat.
36,Bad,"Not only 1 1/2 hours late, but the barrage of shouty announcements throughout the flight made the whole experience unnecessarily unpleasant. Cheap (ish) but not cheerful."
37,Bad,"Simply terrible. Late, couldnt care less attitude by cabin crew, shouting match with ground crew, checkin was a disgrace. I dont understand how they can stay in business."
38,Bad,"They don t care about people, they put you in a full bus waiting in front of the airplane after you already waited 40 min at the gate for the bus to come"
39,Bad,Always thought it was a good way to travel. I’m only 13 stone and can’t fit in the new type aircraft seats. They are only fit for children. Shame they let that happen
40,Bad,First time ever in over 40 years of flying I've been told I couldn't put my jacket in the overhead locker - they are reserved for (prepaid) luggage. Crew very unfriendly and not very pleasant at all. Won't be flying with them again.
41,Bad,That Pilot buttered the bread on that landing. Some girl legit (I’m not kidding) screamed. The flight attendants were mean. Boarding was absolute Chaos. The legroom was ok. I’ve never really had a worse experience other than on my air Koryo flight.
42,Bad,"A week old plane and the seat trays were dirty and there were drink stains on the carpet. The plane was the 737 Max that Ryanair are not calling them that name by and have to be the most uncomfortable seats I have ever travelled in. I am only 5.10""and my knees were tight to the seat in front and had to make sure I kept my elbows tucked in as I was in the aisle seat."
43,Bad,"After lots of bullc.... about missing paper work, turns out they lied, it was technically error. We needed to go back to terminal and wait. Ok, it happens. Then we got told there would be compensation voucher for eat and drink since flight delayed more than 3 hours. Noone Came for 2 hours, we had to search for ryanair employee. Then.... Voucher for 35 nok. 35!! Is this a joke? The voucher not Even covered 0,5l water bottle..."
44,Bad,"We're waiting for 2 months for a refund for a delayed flight, and nobody replies to our messages on several channels.
The cabin crew was impatient and rude"
45,Bad,Paid for cabin bag but people who had not paid for cabin bag bringing rucksacks and and cabin bags onboard
46,Bad,I was bitten on the backs of my legs during the flight by what must have been fleas in the seat or the carpet. With the fast turnround times I suppose there is no time for a proper vacuum or spray.
47,Bad,"Departure almost on time, only 30min late or so. Boarding went smoothly. Unfortunately it did not look that the plane was cleaned before the flight."
48,Bad,I was glad that I paid more for extra legroom as my husband is tall. Sad that their idea of extra legroom is none at all.
49,Bad,"We had a beautiful, very relaxing flight with Ryanair and were so glad we arrived safely in Lanzarote. But we were really annoyed that paid for a bus transfer to our accommodation when it Came up as an option while we were booking our flights from Dublin to Lanzarote. Nobody showed up for us and we had to pay for a taxi. Why ask us to pay for transfer from the airport and not show up for us.??"
50,Bad,"People Clapping? Medal? Melts... The seats were not that comfortable, upon arrival i had to pay an extra £30.00 for my bag, wish this was stated on my flight in the first place."
51,Bad,"The check in process was not working on the app, the website, the phone or the computer. I chat with Ryanair the day before the flight they said it would be solved . They had no solution at the airport, they charged me and insulted me, they just ignored the problem and obliged me to pay or they would cancel the flight. Last time with these people now I will flight with other airlines"
52,Bad,Stuck on flight as it was grounded and they refused to let us off for fresh air for 3 hours with no food and water
53,Bad,Unless your under 36 inch wait don't expect to fasten your seat belt. Paid for extra leg room both ways on the way out I was given seat belt extension but on the way back it was not legal so we had to switch seats.
54,Bad,The worst f****** flyight in my whole life....we have to buy watter 5e ! It was terrible never again with rynair!!!!!!!
55,Bad,"Expensive tickets, poor customer support.
No interest in clients opinions. There were families with kids sleeping on the airport floor and no communication from Ryanair"
56,Bad,More than an hour late going and coming. Very little and often misleading information provided. Untidy cabin on top of everything.
57,Bad,"Seat where I should seat 23F - floor, seat in front of me and wall was covered with vomit. No one from crew didn't take care of this situation."
58,Bad,"The lady who checked out passport and flight told us that we couldn’t bring our hot drink on the plane. She was very rude. The drink was basically full and when I went into the plane, the attendants said we could bring our drink. Very disappointed."
59,Bad,Very unpleasant Spanish check-in staff at the airport. The woman harassed people unreasonably and was rude . I was my first and last time in Lanzarote
60,Bad,"WORST AIRLINE ON THE PLANET. EXPENSIVE, CRAP. AVOID THIS AIRLINE AT ALL COST. DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FAMILY MEMBERS SO YOU HAVE TO BUY SEATS"
61,Bad,"They cancelled my flight and didn't refund me. NEVER AGAIN. They offer the worst costumer support. Never helped me with anything, almost lost my mind trying to deal with them."
62,Bad,"It fits the metal cage with plenty space around yet they wanted to charge me today on flight to glasgow from Lanzarote!!! Lack of ethics, not humane, Ryanair is worst flight company eveeer!!!!!!"
63,Bad,Delayed coming and going Ryanair farming out flight to another foreign budget airline - shocking service and first and last time with an incompetent airline- my advice avoid at all costs
64,Bad,"Ryanair is the worst Airline on the planet. They lie, cheat, and are generally the lowest form of human life from the top down."
65,Bad,"It was my first time I had traveled with Ryanair .. it will be last time,, I will never travel with them again… it is horrible .."
66,Bad,"If the airplane ticked costed 1 dollar, it wouldn't be worth the degradation and the horrible experience we had. This company stand's for everything I'm against for. Never again!"
67,Bad,"Horrendous!! Never use this airline if you can avoid it. Staff incredibly unpleasant, the whole experience is a con to try and ensure the company gets more money. Worst company on planet earth!"
68,Bad,"Will never fly this piece of garbage airline again. Delays, delays, delays, every single one of their flights was delayed."
69,Bad,Used my card details to book someone else's flight and application swapped my details with passenger details. Now Ryanair wants me to pay £115 for name change. Passenger details were 100% correct in the first place. Thats a scam. Avoid them!
70,Bad,The airline won’t let you check in online and require you to cue to collect your boarding pass. Unless of course you want to pay an additional amount to check in online.
71,Bad,"Worst experience , no proper guidance or help on airport, just charging money for checking in for baggage on airport,"
72,Bad,Now force you to queue at airport to print ticket unless you pay extra to buy a seat. No mobile boarding passes without. A new low!
73,Bad,Now force you to queue at airport to print ticket unless you pay extra to buy a seat. No mobile boarding passes without. A new low!
74,Bad,"Ryanair is unacceptable! I made a booking for an international flight and they don't issue an invoice or a receipt for the company i am working, although their booking system let me choose if i want an invoice for an international flight. The customer service is rude and they simply don't care. Never book a flight with Ryanair again!!!!"
75,Bad,"Flight delayed, no apologies and ended up flying to a different airline (stanstead). A new low Avoid, not worth it."
76,Bad,"The worst company I have tried before. You can sell a ticket for Dusseldorf but actually That stop in Weeze, an airport 70 km from Dusseldorf city. They should be more clear about the final destination"
77,Bad,After horrible experience I won't take them even for free. They are denying each other. Cost me extra 233 Euros
78,Bad,hidden fees. fees are not clearly stated so they can charge passengers. They mislead us by this. bad customer service.
79,Bad,Airport Check-in fee of 55 € was hidden! Not explicitly mentioned like other fees while booking!! You are misleading people. We are sooooo disappointed!!
80,Bad,Worst experience ever. You have to pay to sit together on the plan. Then the stewards were trying to charge me for a small bag on the plane. Even though it was the size advertised as free. Terrible experience from stary to finish and i will never use them again. AVOID IF POSSIBLE
81,Bad,"So many hidden fees, just not worth it. €55 just to check in to the flight, what a joke. All other airlines are free. Will not be travelling with Ryanair again"
82,Bad,Worst air company in the world. Never buy tickets by them. Flight has been cancelled and they don't want to refund money back.
83,Bad,Worst staff at Bergamo airport they purposefully make to wait for checkin until it closes in the system incase of issues with checkin and force you pay the airport fee.
84,Bad,"Very unethical, shady hidden fees at every corner. I’m surprised they didn’t have a secret “breathing air” fee. And they don’t tell you ahead of time. They don’t let you check in very far ahead of time. And they also don’t take cash. They nearly got me stranded overseas. Customer service was HORRIBLE! Worst airline ever; I’ll never use this airline again."
85,Bad,"This blonde women working for ryan air made me pay $80 to check in because the app didn’t work. Most rude worker ever, I hope she had Been fired. Would never fly ryan air again, biggest joke."
86,Bad,"Disgusting cleanliness (one of the many pictures attached) in the aircraft. Very unprofessional. After having accepted everyone with big luggages, pillows and three bags each, my luggage wasn't accepted for the size of the wheels. When I complained about it, the steward at the desk started to shout using swearing words. Embarrassing. The most disgusting company ever."
87,Bad,"They're thieves. They took €66 from us because we couldn't pay online due to their website not working. And we didn't know that we had to pay to register in person. This has happened to several people. Give us our money back, you scammers!"
88,Bad,"The airline is a complete farce, systems that don’t work and then want to charge you for their incompetence. They don’t even look after their own flights and swissport are just as incompetent if not worse."
89,Bad,"Horrible and unfriendly. They cancelled my flight two days in advance and didn't care at all about how I would reach my final destination. They only thing they said was that there were no suitable Ryanair flights in the next four days. I could get my 39 Euros flight refunded, which doesn't help much, of course... Never again with Ryanair!"
90,Bad,Absolute horrible experience. Their app was down so wouldn’t let you check in and regardless of this they charged you extortionate amounts to check in. Already purchased cabin baggage but they still charged me again! The staff were hopeless as they don’t know what’s going on themselves and some were so rude but tbf not their fault they work for a sh*tty airline. Terrible experience never again.
91,Bad,"We had to wait in Rinas tirana Airport for 1 hours in side the plane and no Air conditioning at all
I asked for glass of water for my medication and I was refused"
92,Bad,Ryan air is a horrible airline. Never again. They “cheap rates” is a big lie and you still won’t get value for your money.
93,Bad,Left stranded in a foreign Country after they cancelled our flight. They are now refusing to refund the flights. Do not trust.
94,Bad,VERY OLD AIRPLANE WITH NARROW AND OLD AND DIRTY SEATS THE SEATS WERE FOR HALF THE SURFACE OF A NORMAL POSTURE
95,Bad,"I had to pay for my bag, which I have already paid for. When I purchased the ticket I bought 1 small bag and 1 hand luggage. From Malta to Sofia no issues but back to Malta they told me I have to pay once again. Please note I purchased two way ticket with both luggage."
96,Bad,"Another late departure, why do you recommend me to come here 2h before flught if on time of departure I'm still in a queue in airpot? I could spend 2h more productive than waiting you to sort out a flight... Useless, your cheap prices not exuses you for this level of service..."
97,Bad,"This airline is cheap, but they will find ways to charge fees every step of the way during your travel when you cannot refuse to pay. They are rude and sneaky and will take complete advantage of you. I would avoid using Ryanair and gladly pay a higher price fare with a more professional airline. At least that way I know exactly how much the trip will really cost."
98,Bad,"Don't have priority by right for pregnants is a very bad service, and your employees should be more polite cause other company's have priority without pay for it is a woman's right poor service"
99,Bad,Paid for a 10kg cabin bag online arrived at gate charged me 46 euro saying I should have checked in at gate rip off or what pointed out a tiny print on bottom of ticket reporting to consumer complaints it was a carry on bag now they say priority only are allowed overhead carry on
100,Bad,Appalling...this company should go bankrupt. This flight was missed due to it being a connection and we were ushered out from transfer to go back through security. Next flights were overbooked and couldn't get on so returned back to where the 1st flight came from.
101,Bad,"     i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying ryanairck out to miami the next day. initially my flight was delayed in denver by 3 hours. as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw. the denver to heathrow flight was terrible. the plane was dirty, i was in economy, i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability. the plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus. passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ryanair flight to warsaw. this plane was the smallest 3x3 plane i have seen. packed in like sardines. my ryanairg never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no ryanairg to fly ryanairck to miami. ryanair has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my ryanairg will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there. i mean the ryanairg is sitting in heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ryanair in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my ryanairg to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day. "
102,Bad,"    extremely sub-par service. highlights: no online meal selection. staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. plates were literally grabbed away. i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. no apology. no offer of a napkin. i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. because the seat before me was so tilted, i could ryanairrely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. staff walked down with some water and biscuits. this got exhausted just before she got to me. she just looked at me and walked away. nothing further was offered."
103,Bad,"     Ryanair  is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. i have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak with. customer service had such a thick accent i didn't think they were speaking english. "
104,Bad,    flew from amman to london on nov. 14 2022. not sure what type of aircraft it was. my ticket was economy plus. the flight is 5h35m. we received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. any other food or drink had to be purchased. so we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. it is the third time i have flown with ryanair recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. will honestly never fly them again if i can help it.
105,Bad,"    this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline. i flew with Ryanair airline on august 21st 2022. i had one checked ryanairg that was lost at heathrow airport. i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the ryanairggage belt and many travelers were affected. i filed a report for my missing ryanairg on the same day i arrived at lax airport, and that was on august 21st. i waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the ryanairg or be eligible for a compensation). when i did not receive any update on my lost ryanairg, i filed a claim for compensation, and that was on september 11th. since then, i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. i contacted the ryanairggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting ryanairck to me. every time i talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. this whole experience was a hassle. very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ryanair."
106,Bad,"     flying lhr t5 to cpt november 2022:  ryanair app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. lhr t5 smooth and calm. checking process quick. - but boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  ran ryanairck to checkin to get correct one. ryanairgs also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  someone ran off to find my ryanairgs in the depths of t5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in cape town).  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges. turns out this was false information ... b pier lounge was open. but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -arrived late to the gate (train not working). there was a biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the ryanairthroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). unbelievable that ryanair dispatches planes in this condition. food average. wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). overall experience 2/10. flew air france (fortalaza to cdg to lhr) two weeks earlier which was way better. how emryanairrrassing for ryanair."
107,Bad,    beyond disgusted with the fact that my ryanairggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to ryanair. two pieces reported 29th september. ryanair responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
108,Bad,"    on july 19th 2022 i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ryanair had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which i had provided all copy of receipts for. i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, i sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks i will be receiving it. it's 4 months later and Ryanair  has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter."
109,Bad,"     i booked the flight on oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i can't get my entry visa in time for the flight. and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. but in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. so i requested cancellation, but ryanair canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? i assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, i still have not received any refund, so i reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ryanair. i tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. ryanairsed on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. given all i have experienced, i have zero faith in Ryanair ."
110,Bad,     london to gibraltar on 25th october 2022. i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  ryanair attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutriryanairr as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ryanair aim to be positioned at of late. the a320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. the staff disappeared for most of the flight. the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. 
111,Bad,"     just a few years ago flying on ryanair was enjoyable, but times have changed. these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. the terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. on board though, itâ€™s just become an experience to be endured. ryanairâ€™s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. there is no entertainment, no magazine. refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal ryanairr. on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a ryanairg around a toilet door down the ryanairck in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. on the return flight, for one reason or another due to ryanairâ€™s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldnâ€™t travel at all because there were not enough crew. the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. altogether, i would say good things if there were any - but itâ€™s hard to think of anything i could recommend ryanair for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys."
112,Bad,"    ryanairby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. my second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple ryanairg of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. ryanairggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy ryanairgs had been delivered. a380 is a great aircraft but the ryanair seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (proryanairbly not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"
113,Bad,"     we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on 4th october, there were a lot of americas heading ryanairck to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews. the woman at the counter was rude, i was actually emryanairrrassed to be Ryanair at the time. shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. on the flight from london to san francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, i spent Â£150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america. once we boarded, it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken. the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. attitude with Ryanair  staff has been absolutely horrendous. so, after getting off the flight, i decided to make a complaint to Ryanair . bearing in mind that i had paid Â£150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. i paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. all they have now offered me is a Â£50 ryanair voucher, which i declined on the ryanairsis that if they picked my seats (for example i hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a Â£50 voucher would be ok, but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. after all my experiences with ryanair, i will not be using them again. very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that ryanair treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great ireland."
114,Bad,"     while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating. i got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. "
115,Bad,"     5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainment. in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase."
116,Bad,"    the check-in process was smooth. i got access to the iga lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge. on board was what all this flight was about. this was my first time flying intra-european business class, and though i was well prepared, i still found it underwhelming. first, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. there is no personal ife, so ryanairsically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago. i could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. also, the 32 passengers shared one single wc, meaning a long line for the ryanairth room, something i have rarely seen in business class. arrived at lhr, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. it finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since ryanair is the main operator at heathrow t5, such things will affect their reputation."
117,Bad,"     my 7am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. they did not work with me as i miss 2 days of conference. they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden (stockholm); which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice - but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself. upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure, i saw a direct flight to heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. so i changed to 8.15am from gothenburg - heathrow - jersey. however, at this point ryanair told me i have to pay a fee of gbp 710 as i â€œchanged my flight a 2nd timeâ€.  i find it a disgrace that ryanair charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. ryanair proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense. i have since contacted ryanair for the legal compensation iâ€™m entitled to according to uk law, but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination. if i have a choice, i will never travel ryanair again. such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs."
118,Bad,"     london to istanbul. Ryanair  business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. front rows about 5-7 are considered as business class, with very short leg space.  no pillows, no blanket, horrible inflight service, staff were harassing me. no curtesy for business class check-in while waiting for flights. "
119,Bad,     manchester to seattle via london. i will never fly ryanair again. they cancelled my return flight from heathrow ryanairck to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester. the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. i will not be flying ryanair again
120,Bad,"     our flight in march 2022 from san francisco to london on 28th march was cancelled with 3 hoursâ€™ notice. we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. we had to stay overnight for the next day flight. we still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. it is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. during this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). this should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. we were given a voucher. this voucher was only bookable by phone. when i phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying ryanair were not taking flight bookings by phone. you can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? all i have been offered is another voucher. the time to use has passed. it must be great to be a business that can print endless a4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. we returned home with aer lingus with no drama."
121,Bad,"     i was told i'd require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into philippines. booked my trip via ryanair.com, with a transfer in singapore. they delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when i try to check in at changi airport, the philippines airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush ryanairck to check in ...the gate had closed.  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel, book my own flight to manila, then also the return journey ryanairck to london. if one misses one leg of a ryanair booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  i discovered oman air business class and better then Ryanair , from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
122,Bad,"     having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, i boarded the plane on this ryanairsis. i was subsequently dumped at ryanairrcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. there was no help at there to find a hotel. i have ms and can't walk without help, ryanair did nothing, their partners iberia did nothing. at about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. i lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. ryanair insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. i would not have got on the plane had i known. i found out i could go to arbitration. ryanair now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if i do. their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is ryanaird enough. for someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers. so for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with ryanair."
123,Bad,"     i am a business class customer. Ryanair  cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with 3 stops. after i complained, they changed the date. when i told them the date would not work, they attempted to charge me additional $5,000 for the change. i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything.  if you try to reach out, no chance."
124,Bad,"     holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. at our arrival in amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at london heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when i arrived in london, the suitcase was missing, left in amsterdam. 2 suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. no compensation, no dates on when will i get my property ryanairck, no information, lies and more lies.  i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and i might receive the money ryanairck in 30 days! yes, i might."
125,Bad,    despite ryanair's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the chief executive) have remained unanswered. do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises. some things just do not change at ryanair.
126,Bad,"     refund process is non responsive i have been following up on my refund since october, 2021 which is 9 months now. i have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to [emailÂ protected] several times and all they tell me is itâ€™s been processed. Ryanair  customer service is ryanaird and needs to be worked on. till today i have not received my refund. i am just wondering what is happening!"
127,Bad,"     customer service is non-existent. for over a week customer service number message said to call ryanairck in a couple weeks. nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on ryanair.com i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister ryanairck after her husryanairnd died suddenly, my sister and husryanairnd had tickets on the july 18 from nairobi to jfk. when ryanair received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. it took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called ryanairck. the ticket was in premium economy. when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. where is the efficiency? where is the empathy? where is the decency? in addition to the stress of losing her husryanairnd, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. also when i made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. Ryanair  has taken a nosedive in my opinion. words simply don't convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company"
128,Bad,"     for this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a ryanairg of potato chips, and a bottle of water. if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. however there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. they also managed to lose my luggage.  i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. i will never use them again."
129,Bad,"     my wife and i booked a flight in april 2022 that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington. when we checked in at edinburgh airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadnâ€™t done).  we were instructed to come ryanairck in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. we waited and then finally at 1:15 pm, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 pm flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london. we were told weâ€™d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. when we got to security check area the line was massively long. we questioned a ryanair staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. we decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through â€œfast trackâ€ security to make our flight. we got to the gate in time. yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in london 45 mns late, and after going to the â€œflight connectionsâ€ we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of â€œthere isnâ€™t enough time,â€ that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. we were then directed to ryanairggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. when we got to the check-in counter area a ryanair staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. when we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best ryanair could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (iad), but to ryanairltimore. i was not told or assured iâ€™d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that i could go to the ryanair website and make a claim on-line. this ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the uk. "
130,Bad,"     over 1 week ago i cancelled 2 club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before. they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher, so i opted for this online. since then, absolute silence and ryanair pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). as a very loyal ryanair customer for more than 40 years, i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. with a further 6 bookings with ryanair planned for the rest of 2022, i have to admit that travelling with them (ex lhr) has now become an absolute nightmare."
131,Bad,"    washington to london. our flight was unexpectedly cancelled. my husryanairnd spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). when we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!"
132,Bad,"     departure was about 40 minutes late. the a350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted ryanairck, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, i gave up trying to watch. the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. i am going to explore other options before using ryanair again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport."
133,Bad,"     ryanair cancelled my flight, i never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees.  i was booked onto a flight with ryanair for april 29th 2022 from hong kong to london. they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date; covid ticketing flexibility assurances? couldn't find a flight up to and including october. so i opted for the refund thinking i'd get a full refund. i was refunded about 1/5 of what i paid. i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and i didn't get a full refund. each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. and thats where the frustration begins. the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. a month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what i paid. it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up. so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why i wasn't getting a full refund. i didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk. after another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation. we're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022. your claim's been refused because ryanair0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. further to your request, i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. thanks again for following this up with us. please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. best regards Ryanair  customer relations"". i don't know what ""non payable commercial reason"" is. i am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company."
134,Bad,"     belfast to london on 20 jun, 0650. i was informed at about 0200 flight ryanair1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach london heathrow at 1025. i reached the airport at 0445, but ryanair counter was only open at 0510. at checkin counter, i approached ryanair ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. the reply was â€œit is the customerâ€™s responsibility to contact the airline, thereâ€™s nothing we can doâ€. i was given a card with contact info on ryanair customer service and sales. for the next 2 hrs in the airport, i have been trying to contact ryanair, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, i have to called another number for â€œurgent casesâ€, which ever number i dial, i just couldnâ€™t get to speak to any one till 0757. again, i was told that thereâ€™s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines. onboard the aircraft, when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, i was told that itâ€™s the customerâ€™s responsibility to do it on their own.  i would think twice to take ryanair in the future."
135,Bad,"    ryanair is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. good old times of being a glamour flying ryanair has far gone. ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. you pay extra for absolutely nothing."
136,Bad,"     this a new route which ryanair introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays. the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. plus - helpful and friendly fa. minuses - the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. it was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the fa found it difficult. the in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, tv programmes and music. the food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. i don't know what the business class offerings from ryanair's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia."
137,Bad,"     as a regular ryanair customer on european flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays. staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew. the benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly ryanair is in a time warp over this. ryanair pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. the food standards and choices in the t5 first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid. inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in club europe only 4 salad options were available. no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. it appears there is no supply control in place at ryanair. food quality was okay, but while do&co supply this, theÂ do&co meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ryanair managesÂ (i flew turkish 10 days ago). staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin.Â i end where i started, ryanairÂ standards continue to slip.Â "
138,Bad,"     the a80 is a wonderful aircraft - quieter than any other aircraft i've flown. flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london, which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed. passengers waited almost 90 minutes at london terminal 5 for ryanairggage to arrive - excuse given by ryanair ground staff was that the ryanairggage staff are ""very busy right now"" and our ryanairggage will arrive ""soon."" onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient ryanairck support. meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ryanair - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast. cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flight. overall, a fairly disappointing experience with ryanair."
139,Bad,    covid form is broken - called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone. 1 hour flight delay - was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane. i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have 3 hours drive left after i arrive at the airport. in short: totally not customer friendly. will try to avoid flying next time with ryanair.
140,Bad,"     worst airline experience ever. flew 7 people business class. check in was a disaster. the claimed i had â€œexchangedâ€ tickets. after 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. we were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. the ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone. this airline is a complete disaster, please do not fly them. "
141,Bad,"     as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ryanair customer i am appalled at the companyâ€™s recent drop in standards. we were booked to fly from zhr-lhr on a miles ticket in february 2022. when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our ryanairggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked ryanairggage. we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our ryanairggage. we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. i tried contact ryanair customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didnâ€™t bothered to respond. at the 3rd attempt, after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free ryanairggage included with our ticket. at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my ryanairggage charge. however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake."
142,Bad,"     flight delays can happen, but the way ryanair handles such incidents in just way beyond. our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. rechecking our ryanairgs took 4 hours standing in line. a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counter. will certainly never fly ryanair again and do not recommend this airline."
143,Bad,"     check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. easy boarding in sequence numbers. seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice coca-cola, water or red wine. the connecting flight from lhr - man was cancelled with no contact from the airline, i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. the outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of terminal change at lhr from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. overall shocking from Ryanair  and can guarantee i will never use them again."
144,Bad,     we arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to ryanair was terrible. the airport security lines were not managed well. the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced. 
145,Bad,"     ryanair says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, i need to change my flight. i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will - that was apparently a lie. they actually give me a voucher. to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week.  i am panicked so i try calling them. of course, calling them does nothing. the hotline says that they are too busy. this happens again and again. so, i give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. luckily it shows up quickly, and i rebook. then i need to change my booking again. i go to request a voucher again. this time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when i enter it. so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. finally i call the executive class phone line (which i am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. they do some thing on their ryanairck end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours."
146,Bad,"     when i tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel, but i did not have it, i tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my ryanairnk (where i had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. after a very long time, i got a cover letter which the ryanairnk sent to me, but then to be told i had missed the check in by 2 minutes. they would not let me board, and i missed the flight. so i contacted ryanair, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because i missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ryanair policy. so then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was Â£3500. i originally paid Â£1500 for the flights. i then did a search on google and found flights for Â£1100, flying out with air mauritius and returning with ryanair on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on. unfortunately ryanair had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ryanair site that i needed the insurance document. when i checked in for the mauritius  flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and i had a lovely flight with no issues. every time i fly with ryanair, i have a ryanaird experience and i promise i will never fly with them again. "
147,Bad,     another dreadful mediocre experience with ryanair to malaga. this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon. then on flight the the wi-fi was erratic and guests couldnâ€™t order food or drinks. then the card payment system didnâ€™t work so we gave up on ordering. finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the ryanairgs had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unryanairlanced? really? itâ€™s all one excuse after another with ryanair these days.
148,Bad,"     very low standards for club europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected, aircraft not properly cleaned in athens (there was full rubbish ryanairg left in the seat pocket). no in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame. staff was attentive though and tried their best."
149,Bad,"     i booked a flight to london and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. if my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) i was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (i am 32 and not deaf). sometimes, they would purposely hang up before i said anything. other times, they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight. if i managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor."" in the end, ryanair managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and i booked with another airline on principle. "
150,Bad,"     i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. having paid almost Â£1k extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, ryanair cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. there was no option to get any of the other available flights. the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move. the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. the seats were uncomfortable. food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a ryanairsket. the poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure. "
151,Bad,"    business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was proryanairbly beyond the control of Ryanair  but as it had been closed since january the least Ryanair  could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, i complained about this to ryanair and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ryanair had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account, i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling! this scenario has replayed itself proryanairbly about twenty times now, it is clear that ryanair have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers."
152,Bad,"     i had an incredible rude check in staff at the Ryanair  counter in nice on 16th april 2022. zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal 1 on ryanair0262 13 april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found (Ryanair  partner) at 13:14pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice. after multiple emails ryanairck and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in monaco, it was vital we received the luggage asap, the lady replied â€œif it is so important why donâ€™t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it upâ€ despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning. this has been an appalling experience."
153,Bad,"     we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london. as qantas fly to heathrow, Ryanair  is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ryanair from heathrow to glasgow. we booked this flight in october however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from Ryanair , advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled. to help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport, which is 26 miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh, not glasgow. not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. we booked this as one connecting flight so Ryanair  know that we have just travelled 22 hours from australia. there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for Ryanair . they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly Ryanair  again. "
154,Bad,"     total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport. boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of air france, swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals. menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, ryanair cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced. i wouldn't mind, but on european trips in 2022, ryanair are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight. crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return. ryanair is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.
"
155,Bad,"     the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer. at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the ""points game"" but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable ryanairsis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. this status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check. nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel. i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. in summary would i ever fly with ryanair again? no, not if i had half a chance of going with another airline. "
156,Bad,"    Ryanair  is the most terrible airline iâ€™ve dealt with. they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we canâ€™t make the changes online. they hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. you canâ€™t check in online, the application sucks so much youâ€™re better off trying to code your own app and itâ€™ll proryanairbly work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we canâ€™t verify your documents yet the app and website say youâ€™re verified and ready to go. you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says itâ€™s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online wonâ€™t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.  i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with Ryanair  ever again."
157,Bad,     Ryanair  is the most terrible airline iâ€™ve ever dealt with. they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we canâ€™t make the changes online. they hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip weâ€™d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in japan as ryanair just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers.
158,Bad,"     ryanair continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service, provided by people who shouldn't be in customer service, on tired, dirty and cramped aircraft. out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so ryanair cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the us. "
159,Bad,"    first, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (zrh-lhr, gva-lhr & lhr-zrh), first 2 in economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. the infrastructure however is appalling. zrh-lhr impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. gva-lhr, 2.5hrs late as no-one at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate. lhr-zrh, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! there are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."
160,Bad,"     have not flown economy with ryanair for years, what a shock! hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. and no antiryanaircterial wipes offered. wi-fi advertised but not available on flight. paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to easy jet, ryanair or jetstar. my last time travelling with ryanair after more than 18 years of flying with them. ryanair you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be."
161,Bad,"     complete and utter chaos at heathrow, yet again. surely the ceo, sean doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. the queue for the first wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - ryanair seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. as emerald oneworld, i wish there was an alternative because ryanair has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since bea/boac days."
162,Bad,"     Ryanair  are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new club suite, but ryanair59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines club world product. the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. on boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. we suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of ryanair. frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were proryanairbly the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious ryanairsis of a passenger with a nut allergy. it's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. ryanairggage handling was, however, atrociously slow."
163,Bad,"     we flew to funchal, madeira yesterday. madeira has no covid restrictions for entry, yet ryanair asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes, before we could check in online. i received an ok about an hour later, but my husryanairnd did not, so i couldnâ€™t check in online. we arrive at heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. there were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue ryanairrely moving. i went to complain to various ryanair staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. one blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadnâ€™t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. the whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. and completely unnecessary! if we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. my husryanairndâ€™s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for madeira. i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did i, even though iâ€™d previously been told, i could check in online. also unnecessary as if ryanair had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. a staff member told us ryanair had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated ryanairdly, they didnâ€™t want to. the flight itself was fine, on time. we were given a ryanairg of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy."
164,Bad,"     absolutely ryanaird experience with "" Ryanair ."" i have two bookings with them for the past two years. both were cancelled. the first one, i understand, "" covid-19"" unexpected. but today i got another surprise. my flight to antalya in may 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is given. i will definitely not book ever again with them."
165,Bad,"    i really canâ€™t believe they have the audacity to call this first class. the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. the official ryanair lounge in singapore was closed, so theyâ€™re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. suffice to say it was not pleasant. onboard was like being in the middle of a ryanaird comedy sketch. i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. i had to ask for slippers. the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. i mean itâ€™s first class, not a student house party. neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. most of the food was awful. my steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapÃ© of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. i will say, the cheese and port were nice. however the worst thing was the constant galley noise. there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1k) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so weâ€™re in and out of that as well. i will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally iâ€™m happy in club and would never do first again."
166,Bad,"     london to duryanairi. family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ryanair for first time. but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at 7am. we had no time to eat at lhr so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. movies are all outdated and already watched. so overall very medium experience."
167,Bad,"    one would think that the number of crises ryanair incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. i last flew with ryanair may 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one it crisis. i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug 2018 to bologna - ryanair cancelled the flight. then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. fast forward to feb 26th, 2022. received a message 5.30am 30mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled. arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. the staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the ryanair systems were down or ring ryanair. ha ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr. by some miracle the app sprung into life, and i managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. by 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. pointed out ryanair should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. eventually got to departures and made it through security. ryanair customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as ryanair were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. boarded flight 45mins late. sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal ryanairr for a five-hour flight they purport to be a top-class airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse. the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so ryanairdly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. the aircraft are cramped and worn. i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ryanair ticket. how on earth can ryanair justify their prices? the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline."
168,Bad,"     Ryanair  is getting worse an worse, my flight was 8 mins late. luggage is taking hours to arrive.  no communication whatsoever from anyone. they can't be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails, if they do. my app is crashing most of the times. they change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do."
169,Bad,    paid for 3 business class seats to london from new york. got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class. couldnâ€™t even provide compensation or a refund. told i had to call customer service or submit a form. unbelievable. unacceptable. never again. 
170,Bad,"     absolutely shambolic customer service. the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible, waited over an hour for my chosen food/drink order to be brought to me. ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so. on board product is average. "
171,Bad,"     our flight ryanairck to athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight home. i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. what's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make ryanairsed on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with, and i will never be flying with them again."
172,Bad,"     there was a mistake on my booking made by ryanair. got an email to say ""contact us to discuss"". took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved. absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced. still waiting for the call ryanairck i was promised 2 weeks ago."
173,Bad,"    the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. sadly, ryanair59 makes use of the old club world product, which now seems like a step ryanairck in time after experiencing the new club suite on ryanair42/43. there are some good points about the old club world - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an emryanairrrassment. the tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to ryanair's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. arrival was on schedule, but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our ryanairggage."
174,Bad,"     Ryanair  continues to go downhill. we flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. we were packed in full 3x3 seats because of it issue the day before. even if werenâ€™t, the seat pitch and width is the same as economy. gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. the food was dreadful. the in flight service was unsophisticated. ryanair used to have an acceptable european business class. they donâ€™t any more. other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. ryanair is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. how i miss the politeness of old ryanair business class from around 5 years ago, how i used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. covid is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful."
175,Bad,"     Ryanair  has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboardÂ flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. ryanair454 from london to malaga on 25th february, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and i was one of them. this was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules?Â "
176,Bad,"     for once more ryanair got it all wrong with 6 hours delay, food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or advice. no staff to serve the waiting passengers. the attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity."
177,Bad,"     very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economy. check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers. special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored. i spoke to a ryanair customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter. telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable."
178,Bad,     appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking. hours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can't take the call). they don't respond to emails sent to the complaints line. 
179,Bad,"     unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. the ryanaird was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wifeâ€™s didnâ€™t, and post ipad era just donâ€™t live up. the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. iâ€™m afraid ryanair has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
180,Bad,"     i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on Ryanair  from detroit to ryanairngalore and ryanairck. given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class. from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in. when we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come ryanairck to get us when the counter freed up. needless to say it never did. finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. so i come ryanairck to the question: can big corporations lie with no accountability? why would i spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? shame on you Ryanair  for your complete disregard for your passengers. stop your lying or update your promises!"
181,Bad,"     i have flown with ryanair for many years and today was another poor experience as iâ€™ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. i understand that itâ€™s been a tough two years for airlines but ryanairâ€™s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. enormous queues at jfk ryanair check-in terminal 7. even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining theyâ€™d miss their flights. terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. at times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ryanair staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. the interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the ryanairck of the plane who apparently wasnâ€™t pulling his weight. very poor. i used to be a proud ryanair flyer but now i just feel like iâ€™m clinging on to my airline status which doesnâ€™t actually provide you a better service these days."
182,Bad,"     the entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. my food left something to be desired. two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didnâ€™t work. the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. just overall a very ryanairsic generic airline."
183,Bad,"     straightforward and friendly ryanairggage drop. on to south lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our ryanairgs on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. menu was ryanairsic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. ordered a frittata as was so hungry. made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had ryanairsic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and shouldâ€™ve gone to the lounge near there. looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. however, the doors cannot close till take off. i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour. lunch came in another almost hour. asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didnâ€™t, with no apologies or even trying. portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. chocolates are lindor. nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what youâ€™d expect, amenity kit was ryanairsic, duvet seemed well used. it was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. naive to trust claims of world class standards."
184,Bad,"     in glasgow one check in desk open. huge queue with no business check in. it took me close to an hour to ryanairgdrop. getting onto the aircraft in glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  i normally find ryanair cabin crew very nice. breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  i used the ryanair lounge in terminal 3. not very keen on the new table service. poor choice and miniscule portions. lounge staff were very nice in both directions. on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t5 to t3. we were packed in like sardines. so much for social distancing. the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push ryanairck and when it did eventually arrive there were no ryanairggage handlers to load the containers. no drinks or anything offered while we waited. food was not even worth mentioning. as far as club europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. no priority ryanairggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa- sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ryanair, and he was right. for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time. i've never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time. pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. on board i gave the food a miss.  heathrow ryanairck to glasgow flight left on time. food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined.  both cases were last off again. club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. i would have thought that ryanair would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."
185,Bad,"     i paid $1189 for a round trip flight to london and ryanairck in premium economy. they bumped me from the seat for the flight ryanairck, and told me i'd be issued a refund. instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, twitter, and finally email. they told me i'd be getting $229.16 ryanairck, which is less than half of the $589 i paid for the upgrade. instead they refunded $14.58. i emailed again and they told me i'd be getting $115.16 more ryanairck. when i emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with ""that's the final amount."" turns out that meant they were taking ryanairck the initial refund of $14.58 and i was only getting $115.16 total. so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond. so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me."
186,Bad,"     i had low expectations of business class ryanair on european routes but this flight was even worse. t5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check ryanairgs with tons of people arriving late. check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc. ryanair lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just ryanaird all round. boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. a320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. there is no inflight screen no overhead screen. although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward ryanairthroom with no crew sending them ryanairck. the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ryanair. the next day i flew the same aircraft type to ryanairhrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. ryanair hang your head in shame."
187,Bad,"     my flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather. airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ryanair app, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my ryanairgs ryanairck, i was told to cancel my booking on the ryanair app, they could not do it at the desk. i was then directed via a gate to collect my ryanairgs, this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a ryanairggage belt, then i waited for my ryanairgs for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my ryanairgs for the following days flight. ryanair staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time ryanairgs were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day."
188,Bad,"     it is first time we have flown ryanair business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. it was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. no complaints at all in that department. food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing ryanairckwards, as are both the centre seats. we were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. you cannot see out. you cannot see other passengers. it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. in most business class seats you can tuck your ryanairg under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a ryanairg, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. we were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. i am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. my wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ryanair in future, if at all possible."
189,Bad,"     i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons. i have sent them a complaint per e-mail and i still didn't get a reply. it has been 4.5 months and i am still waiting for an answer. furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service."
190,Bad,"    Ryanair  is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. ryanair did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, i am not going to travel on ryanair again and may not travel again this year at all."
191,Bad,"     i have a flight booked for january 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed. my second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. what kind of answer is that? i mean i still need to fly to where i am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive. it is a very big inconvenience for me and i don't even get an apology, just cancel!"
192,Bad,"     i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. i'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that i'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by ryanair themselves) - but on a new date. how wrong i was. first, i had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times. the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines i'd redeemed. they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. however, if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did, so i cut my losses and booked the flight. or at least i thought i did. the call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and cvc code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra ryanairg would follow. a week later, i still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. i called up to confirm. the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. once again, i waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to Ryanair  as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  on the friday before my monday flight, i sat in tears to another ryanair call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra ryanairg. the next day - around 48 hours before i was due to fly, i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra ryanairg. luckily, i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a ryanairg online. the whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to Ryanair  hold music. furthermore, there has been a significant cutryanairck to ryanairs inflight catering service due to covid, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. though i've flown ryanair repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
193,Bad,"     extremely disappointed in trip experience. i am gold mvp 100,000+ miler with alaska airlines. my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines. when speaking with alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on Ryanair  in accomplishing this task. i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process.  i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska (as 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (delta). who does that without notifying the customer. i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was. they explained Ryanair  had rebooked with delta. this took about 30mins with customer service. then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out. i am so frustrated."
194,Bad,"     Ryanair  seems happy to encourage the spread of covid. took the 7am flight from t5 at heathrow to paris cdg on 22nd november, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. it is shameful that ryanair ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how ryanair seem happy to disregard any covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. in contrast, on recent air france and iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk. "
195,Bad,     i was refused an early check in and was told to come ryanairck at 2:30pm for a 5.05pm departure. there was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger.
196,Bad,"    check in was ok, all documents were scanned without problems. the flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m25. not the airlines fault. 3 replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a321 neo went ahead. the club europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off. for me at 5.11 tall, i can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. the inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. the crew failed to work as a team. you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. landing and disemryanairrking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. not ryanair's finest hour."
197,Bad,"     after 1h queuing at the check-in desk, i am told that my booked seat is not available. why do you sell seats that you do not have?"
198,Bad,"    3 hours standing in line for boarding pass. airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically. then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight. and yes, we used verifly. my flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutes. they are so unorganized and slow! getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines. you have to wait even though i paid for it. avoid this airline at all costs! absolute worst!"
199,Bad,"    i have been trying to get a hold of ryanair to change my return flight for the past week now. i cant change online because i'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online. i've tried live chat several times and waited 2.5 hours only to be told there's no one available (during business hours). i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end. customer service is non existent. however, of course if you call the ""new booking"" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently. shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn't deserve to be a national airline. i haven't had these problems at all and i've been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately). it's been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i don't even speak spanish. "
200,Bad,"     this whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles. drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about. would not even allow me to add tier points. the flight to london was marred with problems. in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent. this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email. we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield. the resort (riu paradise beach) was riddled with ryanaird food, drugs and ryanaird attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ryanair staff to sound off too. the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving ryanairck at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday. there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month. now we all know this is a better option."
201,Good,"Flight was on time, aircraft clean, very good crew, good leg room for an hour flight, smooth and good information from the cockpit and cabin crew. Paid £98 return, and was sucked into paying for a window seat at the front by communications from Ryanair before I travelled, classic ancillary revenue emails, and they worked!! I had a fare that permitted one cabin bag and one check-in bag, looking at the cost of the same on BA/EI the saving was massive, and to be honest for an hour who cares what food and drink you have to buy!! Well done Ryanair, def use you again, most impressed."
202,Good,"Great value flight at the right time from the local airport, staff are always friendly and helpful and it suits our needs, nothing wrong with that."
203,Good,"We fly with this airline regularly and couldn’t fault them. The staff are very courteous and friendly, the flights are usually on time, we’ve never had any issues with getting a compensation after a couple of delayed flights. Our recent flights to/from Madeira arrived on time, we felt very safe with the skilled captain - Madeira airport can be tricky, however, the landing was smooth."
204,Good,"I recently flew with Ryanair, and I was impressed by the overall experience. The airline offers a no-frills, cost-effective option for travel without compromising on efficiency. The booking process was straightforward, and their commitment to punctuality was evident throughout my journey."
205,Good,"The cabin crew was professional and friendly, making the flight enjoyable. Despite the affordable prices, the seating was comfortable enough for the duration of the flight. The airline's dedication to keeping costs low is reflected in their transparent pricing model, allowing passengers to tailor their experience according to their needs."
206,Good,"While additional amenities may come at an extra cost, I appreciate the flexibility this provides for travelers who prioritize budget-friendly options. Overall, Ryanair provides a reliable and economical choice for those looking to travel without breaking the bank."
207,Good,"I travel very often with Ryanair and it is a very reliable airline. 90% of the time there are small or no delays. On the airplane the legroom is very often bigger than of some regular cost airlines. Meal is not included in the price , but many regular cost airlines are offering also nothing (like TAP Portugal) or something completely tasteless. In reality you get with 50% lower price almost the same service as the average airlines.This flight from Thessaloniki to Stockholm was also a pleasant experience just as usual, with a very cheap price. Value for money airlines."
208,Good,"Having been a regular customer with Ryanair ove the years, I know what to expect, you get what you pay for, no bells and whistles!
It's convenient and cheap with very few problems.
Our flight was as comfortable as it could be and even got us there 30 mins early, so can't complain.
If you want something fancier than go elsewhere, it's a budget airline and that's exactly what you get."
209,Good,"We flew to Berlin and back with Ryanair. We couldn’t fault them. They were punctual, well organised and the cabin crew were lovely. A positive flying experience."
210,Good,"Excellent value for money. It’s basic, no frills & great for short flights. Service was great - on time, staff were nice & friendly & it was clean. App is really helpful, we got regular updates & email reminders too. Simple, straightforward & no headache - we travelled as a family with 3 kids under 7"
211,Good,I made a BIG mistake on my personal details when making the booking online and MARLENA sorted it out for me. Many thanks for your priceless help.
212,Good,"Flight to Alicante. 18.05 from Bristol, flight was slightly delayed due to maintenance. The lead cabin crew fully informed all passengers. Lead cabin crew was very joyful, polite and positive. A great leader."
213,Good,I was dreading flying Ryan Air after being a BA loyal customer but I can honestly say it was a really positive experience.
214,Good,"As always, we got everything we booked and a cheap flight that was on time.
Checking in our bag was fast and easy, too."
215,Good,"I must say I have flown many times with Ryanair , the price and service has always been excellent . I love their app also ,great for check ins . It’s 10/10 from me"
216,Good,"Surprised once again by Ryanair. Departed on time.- Excellent departure process.
Did a return as well - same experience- they arrives 30 mins early"
217,Good,Saw loads of bad reviews before flying with Ryanair and I can honestly say nothing bad at all flight on time no delays the staff were lovely I would 100 percent fly again also I had enough leg room
218,Good,I cannot fault Ryanair. The staff were brilliant and the flights enjoyable. I would definitely recommend.
219,Good,"Better legroom and cleaner than Emirates that charge much more .!
Though flight one way was delayed , yet worth flying with Ryanair - value for money !"
220,Good,"Amazing flying with ryanair, our printed boarding passes didn't work in Luton but they sorted them quickly. Polite and Amazing staff in airport and on plane"
221,Good,"We flew CGN-OPO-DTM on Ryanair and I can't complain. I got everything I booked, the flight was cheap, the flight times suited our plans and the flights were on time. I'd fly Ryanair again."
222,Good,Excellent service and staff in very difficult circumstances with so many delays and cancellations and updated info sent directly to phone which did not appear on Nice Airport information
223,Good,We had a very good flight to say it was 30 minutes late into palma we had quick turn around and we was only 10 minutes will fly with ryanair.com anytime from leedsand bradford and palma
224,Good,"Better legroom and cleaner than Emirates that charge much more .!
Though flight one way was delayed , yet worth flying with Ryanair - value for money !"
225,Good,"I'm flying more than 10 years with Ryanair. Never had any issues. It's not luxuruous and you have to pay a bit of attention when booking/checking in, but overall it's fantastic value for money."
226,Good,Ryanair continue to provide fast efficient service. people who complain about this airline don't remember what it was like to fly from ireland at for really high prices. Ryanair offer a freat service and great value for money
227,Good,As usual Ryanair was the best price in the market fab flight from Bristol on time landing and nothing more to say. Cheap & cheerful but great value for money
228,Good,Great value for money; cheap and quality flight; no waiting:polite staff; cheap food and drinks; recomand
229,Good,It was alright my family and I thought it was ok I don’t know what you guys are talking about bad experience
230,Good,"World class and super affordable flight experience. Flight to and from Pula, Croatia to Stansted, UK."
231,Good,"By far the best airline, the food is amazing, the crew is amazing and by far the best thing about Ryanair are the prices."
232,Good,"Very good support center immediately responsive to calls Friendly staff, good flight, despite the delay, very punctual"
233,Good,Just like to say absolutely brilliant service special assistances does i was well happy with there service First class
234,Good,"Can’t fault Ryanair, flown on nearly 500 Ryanair flights in the last 15 years and never encountered a problem. Highly recommended."
235,Good,"I was concerned after reading negative reviews about list baggage or cancelled flights, but no problem at all, would definitely use again."
236,Good,"Nothings ever a problem, lovely, friendly staff and remember, you get what you pay for!
I've flown with these guys quite a few times over the years, never had anything to complain about yet so keep it up Ryanair!"
237,Good,"Thank you Agnieszka and Jose for your fantastic service
I wish Ryanair more employees like them
Fly FR2433 31/03/2023"
238,Good,A member of staff was able to move my seat so me and my partner could sit together! Ryanair said gay rights
239,Good,"Ryanair is a budget airline, you get what you pay for. Flight from Cologne to Stansted left on time and landed early. Cabin crew was friendly. No complaints whatsoever."
240,Good,"Yet another cheap and cheerful flight this time to Porto, in my opinion you cannot beat Ryanair for value and choice of destinations."
241,Good,"Thank you for a great trip with nice people around :) Great chat!
Very good service and hope to meet soon for another good long chat in the sky…"
242,Good,"The online check in by the app was really good. Quick boarding with nice staff and good service. Im absolutely going with Ryanair again, this was my first time ever with them."
243,Good,"Checked in online so straight through security, staff were friendly at the gate and on board. Flight was on time and everything went smoothly."
244,Good,The seats are extremely comfortable and the flight attendants are extremely kind. I would really recommend this airline as it’s really cheap and fun to fly.
245,Good,Great job. Everything was perfect. Flight was very smooth and fast. Service okay we got what we asked for. Great service for price what we paid
246,Good,Ive been flying with Ryanair since 2015 and had no problems at all. The cabin crew is usually friendly and everything is good everytime I fly with them
247,Good,"Lisbon to Birmingham, yet another cheap flight with this carrier, flight a little delayed but not an issue, aircraft was clean and tidy and staff were efficient in what they were doing."
248,Good,"Booked many flights with ryanair over the past years, always very happy with their handling and service"
249,Good,"Excellent airline, I haven't flown with them in a long time. Flights were on time, boarding was seamless. Significantly better than other low-cost companies that operate from Sofia Airport."
250,Good,Excellent airline and now with new app it is very easy to use I like Ryanair and as long as I have money in my pocket well card I will travel with them staff very Friendly also
251,Good,"Got what u paid for, terrible queues but landed safe, can’t fault it. Friendly enough staff would recommend"
252,Good,Ryanair is a very good airline.Dont understand the hate that comes from people.Their landings although sometimes are pretty rough most of the times in my experience have been fine.Very cheap.My only problem is that the legroom is a bit tight.Would recommend!!
253,Good,"The flight was okay, we were late only a few minutes, the legroom was enough for this short flight, but the seats are really uncomfortable.
For this price, I think it was perfect"
254,Good,The flight and cabin crew went as planned with no fuss or delays. Plane was clean and the cabin crew were very friendly.
255,Good,"I had a flight on 6 June 2023, but the flight was cancelled because of the French air was on strike, but Ryanair rebooked me for 7 June 2023. On the was back 14 June 2023. The plane was comfortable for the two and half journey. It all we very smoothly, the only downside was when the flight was cancelled it had taken 36 minutes to get in touch with Ryanair, but when I did they were very helpful."
256,Good,It was are first time flighting with Ryanair the plane was clean and the service was good the only thing what was wrong with it was the coffee was horrible we didn't try the food but we was told that the food is as well
257,Good,Yet another cheap and cheerful flight if you are okay with a couple of inconveniences like changing the outgoing flight time from early morning to evening and a delay of 60 mins on the way back just take it in your stride.
258,Good,"I had a great experience when flying with Ryanair. however, stop overbooking flights. Other than that staff are friendly. Great TIk Tok page aswell love the content"
259,Good,"You know what you're getting when booking.
The prices are repeated through out the booking process.
On time flight's,in fact we were slow at the airport for boarding."
260,Good,"All was ok and had a good journey.
Staff pleasant and well organised.
A few moaning British, having to pay extra for luggage at the gate ( trying to be clever), customers are prewarned."
261,Good,On behalf of my mother I want to say Thank you to flight attendant August Sebastjan Richter for being helpful on flight with heavy hand luggage.
262,Good,Took a flight from Birmingham to Dublin. Cheap flights you get what you pay for. Ok for a short flight but not very comfortable for a flight over a few hours. Staff very friendly.
263,Good,Very good staff but very limited legroom and arm room but that's what you expect when you fly a low-budget airline. Very smooth flight with not much turbulence and very nice staff
264,Good,Can't fault Ryanair. Both flights took off on time and leg room in row 7 was better than expected. Crew were more professional than my previous experience flying with Ryanair. Didn't fly with luggage so that may have helped.
265,Good,Usually avoid cheap no frill airlines but Ryanair is getting better and I couldn’t fault this flight either. Great crew and the process was without issues. Great price too!
266,Good,"As usual with Ryanair the service is fairly basic but, if you don’t go for their extras most flights can be quite cheap. It’s what it says on tin, a budget airline with no frills. Food and drinks however are mighty expensive, take a sandwich with you!"
267,Good,"In the past I have had some rubbish experiences with Ryanair. However, on this occasion I was impressed despite some small delays. Clearly has improved since I last used them."
268,Good,Very smooth both at the airport and the flight so far. Very good to see! Well done much appreciated after the issues this summer.
269,Good,Very smooth both at the airport and the flight so far. Very good to see! Well done much appreciated after the issues this summer.
270,Good,"Ryanair flights both ways were on time, clean and tidy with good cabin crew staff. You know what you are going to get with Ryanair (you generally get what you pay for) so was a good taxi ride!"
271,Good,"Check in and security very quick,boarding a bit chaotic but like many flights these days,onboard leg room was ok,staff friendly,pre ordered pizza and chips for kids,Thai green curry and rice for adults,all were great,arrived on time,baggage delivered quickly,all in all a very good flight"
272,Good,I was on a flight to Tenerife just today and the service was absolutely amazing. The airline itself isn't the best and we had a terrible experience once before but on this flight the stewardesses were very helpful and welcoming.The way there was very enjoyable.
273,Good,"Absolutely smooth service on this occasion. No delays, no issues with luggage. Courteous and friendly cabin crew."
274,Good,"With priority it all went well, even that the majority of the patients seem to have had it. Plane was not full. The meal deal was really OK for this type of flight. Very friendly and efficient crew.
What a difference with the flight back...."
275,Good,Very friendly and helpful cabin crew and excellent flight captain. A nice experience without problems
276,Good,"We found our flight from Ancona to London Stansted was ok, check in ok, boarding ok, flight ok. Only problem was people turning up with PPF2 masks, and extra luggage they had not checked in."
277,Good,"I travelled return to Malaga, it was my first time flying with this company. I had a very good expeirience for each journey, Very polite and pleasant staff."
278,Good,"Cheap but quality travel, Its really budget airline so its just a bus with wings. Plane was cheap, seats were comfortable, landing was hard, but thats their tradition."
279,Good,"Amazing but the landings are quite hard and feel bumpy.The food is really good though.However,I recommend this plane.We have traveled to Portugal this February but our flight was delayed by 20 minutes."
280,Good,"This was a great airline with great prices, except if you don't understand there baggage policies. You will get hit with high extra fees if you have not paid for enough baggage."
281,Good,"Many people say that the company is not good. In my opinion, it is one of the best low cost airlines. To be able to fly for less than 15€ was unthinkable years ago."
282,Good,"Good service, pleasant flight, but if you're a tall individual (like me), I'd recommend spending a bit more and choosing a seat with extra legroom! Overall very good value for money."
283,Good,Not bad for a low cost company - few things can be improved but overall it's been pleasant to fly with them
284,Good,"It was my second time flying with this airline and I had a really good flight. Although it was very foggy in Tenerife, the flight departed on time."
285,Good,"Good experience after all, no delays. Check-in was fast at both airports and customer service was good."
286,Good,"On time, polite ground handling staff, covid precautions taken, clen aircraft. No so comfy seats, but ok. Stewardesses didn make too many anouncements on board. Value for money"
287,Good,Incredible to say but Michael O'Leary must have changed his stance on his Master's in Rudeness. The staff are actually very friendly and helpful! Congratulations.
288,Good,been using ryan air for 5 yrs and always been calm and safe. sometimes their are some rude staff on the airplane but i just choose to ignore. But so far been very content
289,Good,I like Ryanair give them a chance no deaths on Ryanair which is very good I love their new seat designe it's good and that nice food oh cmon give Ryanair a try please.
290,Good,The 2 hour flight was pleasant with no surprises. It was quick and comfy with friendly staff. I would continually recommend this airline for short distances.
291,Good,"I travelled after lockdown, they have a super offer and the plane was almost empty. So I have enough space, and I feel safe keeping security distance."
292,Good,"Cheap but effectively revolutionised air travel in Europe. As much as people complain, they continued to travel and enjoy cheap holidays"
293,Good,"Great airline, had a very comfortable flight , arrived in time and staff were great, anything we needed they were there"
294,Good,Managed to go back home to visit my family with no problems at all. Friendly staff and good customer service for the whole trip.
295,Good,The outbound and inbound flights were both on time. Cabin service was ok with no frills as expected. We had paid for exit seats so plenty of leg room. Every possible addition has a charge attached but all in all it was ok.
296,Good,Brilliant flight on Ryanair flight was on time the service was great all amazing totally recommend
297,Good,Good value and they seemed to have restricted the premium sell out to allow everyone that had a suitcase to go into the overhead locker which queueing up I was not convinced but worked well.
298,Good,"Cheap airline with fast check in. No need to print out ticket, just use the Ryanair apps and your boarding pass is there. Staff is friendly."
299,Good,Flew from Liverpool with another couple for my 50th Birthday.. First time with Ryanair had no complaints.
300,Good,"Plane not full. Staff warm and welcoming. The whole experience was simply straightforward and easy. Great value for money. You've set the bar, looking forward to the next flight, don't let me down."
301,Good,"     i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland, but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight. the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. while the food was typical air plane food. i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights."
302,Good,"     i am happy to say that this flight was quite good. except for the second rate euro business seating, everything was very well done. a friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit. well done. unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival."
303,Good,"    amazing flight and comfortable. the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest. new aircraft. staff very friendly and professional. the food was great, beyond expectation."
304,Good,     i would like to thank you for the great service. i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours. i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight.
305,Good,"     a very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food. crew was wonderful new seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable. entertainment great. wifi was annoying, cutting off and needing constant reconnecting. generally a positive experience."
306,Good,"    arrived at the south airport in tenerife 2 hours before departure, iberia had not opened the check in. even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post covid took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. not sure why. the plane was a very new a321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. the seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inchâ€™s between my knee and the seat in front. food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. good selection of wine to go with a above average salad. overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew."
307,Good,     the service was excellent. the cabin staff were attentive and efficient. the food and drinks were very good. the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice. overall a very enjoyable flight.
308,Good,     the crew at denver airport is top notch! so impressed with their customer service. they were very patient and courteous. thank you all for being amazing.
309,Good,"     very pleasant flight to lisbon! it was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft. however, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big club class cabin. friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers. late breakfast/brunch served was tasty. what a contrast to the iberia crew (lisbon/madrid/london) who were cold and unprofessional."
310,Good,"     check in well organised. no lounge in cancun. efficient boarding process. given water bottle before take off, no welcome drink. now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change. menu good and food acceptable. staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience. managed to sleep a few hours. for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly. this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time."
311,Good,"     i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze. after frustratingly missing my flight due to m25 road closures, she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges. i am really grateful."
312,Good,    fantastic flight down to heathrow. crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times. nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water. itâ€™s a start.
313,Good,"     a short hop from london to edinburgh in november 2019 - efficient, clean and punctual. the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable. i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from."
314,Good,     hong kong to london. great airline indeed! staff were friendly and helpful! the aircraft was very clean. the crews are diverse. will definitely fly again.
315,Good,"     mexico city to manchester via london. my plane from mexico city to london was smooth. entertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasn't actually the window, but a wall! the crew was amazingly kind and lovely. they're always checking on you, and we even got a magnum! loved this airline for my first flight ever."
316,Good,"   Â Â rio de janeiro to london heathrow. love this aircraft, only a 3 class, business, world traveller plus and economy class. 2 cabins in business class front 3 rows and rear 2 rows. i had seat 3a, in my opinion the seat, window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private tucked behind second galley area, toilet is over the other side j/k. i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal. crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately. a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast. i really enjoyed the fruit, yoghurt, muesli and the full english breakfast. all in all great service, good flight and felt fully relaxed."
317,Good,"     sofia to london. a good overall experience. departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia, and complete failure to honour priority boarding. flight experience generally good, and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient."
318,Good,     london heathrow to stockholm. business class short-haul is what it is. seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat. but you get served drinks and food. proper gin for the g&t and good food.
319,Good,"     los angeles to amsterdam via london. due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight. thanks to the excellent premium host service, julie and her colleague, i managed to be on time! thank you very much."
320,Good,     gatwick to st lucia. great service on this flight. thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew. excellent service.
321,Good,     san francisco to london. efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at $760 per person which we declined. refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks. boarding on time but could have been better controlled. flight left and landed ahead of schedule. flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip. business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints.
322,Good,"    london heathrow to seychelles. really great flight, boarding was very quick, the flight was full, seats great 07 a/b good inflight entertainment, plenty of choices. food was good as we already pre-ordered our meals, my beef was well done just how i like it. after a late 30 minute delay we landed on time into seychelles, the crew were very attentive, lots of very demanding passengers. all in all, a good flight after 7 hours of sleep"
323,Good,"     austin to london. another pleasant flight on an ageing 747. after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat, meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger, she kindly swapped seats so we could be together. for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel youâ€™re in your own little world. a good flight, on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect."
324,Good,"    glasgow to london. smooth flight, departure/arrival on time. boarding was quick, the seat was ok. although i had pre-ordered a vegetarian option, the caterer hadn't provided any (so they said) - but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue. the food was good, and the wine (french, bourgogne) also surprisingly good. flight attendant was professional, polite and attentive to detail. all in all, a great flight."
325,Good,     london to munich. the plane is a320. the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a320. it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather. there is enough legroom. however there is no free food and drinks provided.
326,Good,"     hong kong to london heathrow, this is a long haul flight operated by boeing 777-300er. the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable. the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat. this negatively affects the legroom. the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television. they provide dinner and breakfast for me. it is quite abundant but not very delicious."
327,Good,"    premium economy donâ€™t waste your money on an overnight flight! going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! the food (i use this term lightly) wasnâ€™t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didnâ€™t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. the veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (not really a saving grace). one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and donâ€™t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! i didnâ€™t bother trying it. the look on other peopleâ€™s faces was good enough for me to know donâ€™t bother! which in comparison to the outbound flight (london to orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldnâ€™t log on so saved some money there. i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. but that really shouldnâ€™t happen. what is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you donâ€™t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered tsa line thatâ€™s the one thatâ€™s empty cause they tell no one about it."
328,Good,     return flight to dublin. outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast. flight was fine. return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed. lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok. staff on both flights fine. return aircraft quite new and well presented.
329,Good,"     istanbul to london. my first flight in economy is the new a321 neo, the aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats. the seat does not recline, is very thin and ok for an hour flight. however 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours. the 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products."
330,Good,     flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing 747-400 that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness!
331,Good,"     london city to zurich, i fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, the flight was delayed initially by an hour, i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed. around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne, brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. thanks to the crew."
332,Good,"     vancouver to london, we were upgraded to business class at the airport. the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip. really they could not have been more helpful and i would recommend them. "
333,Good,     london heathrow to bengaluru. i found the crew very friendly and even humorous! whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (i was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! 
334,Good,"     london to gibraltar. check in at t3 was fine, lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case. flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine. skilled landing in gibraltar- a good flight"
335,Good,"     rome to london. one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights. the online website is very clear and easy to use. check-in procedure was smooth. the gate was very close to the shopping area. boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge. the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they donâ€™t serve anything free on all european routes."
336,Good,     london to chennai. it was amazing. the crew were very friendly. the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable. t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly.
337,Good,     london heathrow to paris cdg. quick and easy flight to paris. took just 40 minutes to reach cdg. everything went well and the cabin was very clean. the only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized.
338,Good,"    a380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience. the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs. it would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. the ife was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. wifi was available but i didn't make use of it. breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered. deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at t5 and the lack of a stand. overall, a reasonable flight but not first class."
339,Good,"    
the 2-3-2 seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. a full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in first. the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement. the fish option for the main course was some of the best food i've had in the air. the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight. breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. arrival was ahead of schedule."
340,Good,"    i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy. they get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room. boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. the staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. a hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. quality red and white wine was served. the inflight movie selection was ok. a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. not my best flight."
341,Good,"     moscow to london. fantastic first class service. the moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent runway views. quick boarding, and i was escorted to my seat by the crew. the new first seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. there's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal i've had. drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. the crew were very attentive and friendly with it. a fantastic experience, and i'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin."
342,Good,"     glasgow to new york via london. morning flight from gla to lhr was ok. i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk. on the jfk flight the service was fantastic. the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. we left and arrived on time. the seat and legroom was fine. my mothers ife didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. the cabin crew were very friendly."
343,Good,"     london to johannesburg. turning right to the first wing at t5 was a new experience for us. it was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly mr convivial. the concorde room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. boarding involved lining up according to group. this smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but i guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. the first cabin on the a380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. the dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. the wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous lpgs, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. sleep quality was considerably better than club world, although the cabin temperature was a little high. overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel."
344,Good,     london to boston. i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat. the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight. superb customer service.
345,Good,    stockholm to london. standard configuration on short haul european flights. business class still 3 seats each side of the isle. middle seat fitted with a tray. had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business. drinks served with a smile and the food also. food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there. the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding.
346,Good,"     london heathrow to miami. the airport staff was very helpful, the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious. i had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well. overall it was one of the best flights i had."
347,Good,"     london to singapore. it was a wonderful flight.  i was lucky having a 2-seats-row for my own on the upperdeck, but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect. the crew was very friendly and the food was the best i've had on an airplane. if you fly the a380 in economy, book seats in the upperdeck. best seats on the plane: 83a or 83k."
348,Good,"     budapest to london heathrow. the flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft. the ride was a bit bumpy, but was not too serious. the flight was full (with kids) and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth. i did not purchase any food, but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on-board purchases."
349,Good,"     london to paris. i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing. especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it. that being said, this is better than any low-cost carrier."
350,Good,"     malaga to gatwick operated by titan airways. very full business class of 36 people. a sick flight attendant so just one female attendant handled alone. i wish to highly commend here, despite alone she managed perfectly. "
351,Good,"    madrid to london. credit where it's due. flew club europe and the crew were excellent. friendly, attentive and professional. the food was a good standard. the b767 has a dedicated business class cabin with larger seats. think they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service."
352,Good,"    london to sao paulo. overnight club world flight. prompt check in at heathrow and into lounge. no spaces at the spa, galleries lounges were fine and showers clean. good wifi. aircraft was a 777-300 so in flight entertainment was good. they also had wifi on board. crew experienced and were good. service prompt, food reasonable and i liked the new white company offerings. flight arrived early. generally a solid performance."
353,Good,"    efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight. decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from london heathrow to cairo. galleries south lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good. showers clean and well presented. chaotic boarding. well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. slightly delayed departure time made up en route. unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. happy with whole experience. i donâ€™t think i would use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you donâ€™t need to sleep it was fine."
354,Good,"     heathrow to keflavik. i had booked economy, was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded when i checked in online.  priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker range. the inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wine. off loading was straightforward. the return flight was on time, the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat. m&s food service was ok. the cabin crews were slow at taking payment. overall similar experience to an easyjet flight."
355,Good,"    the first class cabins are in need of refurbishment, but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish. the seats were very comfortable and completely functional. entertainment choices were current, varied, and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety. the cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind. the food for dinner, while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience. the breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered. overall, an extremely pleasant experience. there is no wi-fi available on this aircraft type."
356,Good,"     cape town to london. i can report a positive experience on our flight. from the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. seats 4e/f suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. the menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. the ife screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. still no wifi, of course. take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism. an excellent flight, overall."
357,Good,"     i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying ryanairck out to miami the next day. initially my flight was delayed in denver by 3 hours. as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw. the denver to heathrow flight was terrible. the plane was dirty, i was in economy, i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability. the plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus. passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ryanair flight to warsaw. this plane was the smallest 3x3 plane i have seen. packed in like sardines. my ryanairg never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no ryanairg to fly ryanairck to miami. ryanair has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my ryanairg will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there. i mean the ryanairg is sitting in heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ryanair in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my ryanairg to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day. "
358,Good,"     booked a ryanair holiday to marrakech, after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit, i can now confirm that the points have been credited. it took a while but ryanair did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. ryanairsed on things now being resolved i have travelled on ryanair since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on 2nd january, looking forward to the new ryanair concorde lounge. keep it up ryanair, loyalty is indeed a 2way street."
359,Good,"    extremely sub-par service. highlights: no online meal selection. staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. plates were literally grabbed away. i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. no apology. no offer of a napkin. i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. because the seat before me was so tilted, i could ryanairrely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. staff walked down with some water and biscuits. this got exhausted just before she got to me. she just looked at me and walked away. nothing further was offered."
360,Good,    flew from amman to london on nov. 14 2022. not sure what type of aircraft it was. my ticket was economy plus. the flight is 5h35m. we received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. any other food or drink had to be purchased. so we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. it is the third time i have flown with ryanair recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. will honestly never fly them again if i can help it.
361,Good,"     flying lhr t5 to cpt november 2022:  ryanair app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. lhr t5 smooth and calm. checking process quick. - but boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  ran ryanairck to checkin to get correct one. ryanairgs also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  someone ran off to find my ryanairgs in the depths of t5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in cape town).  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges. turns out this was false information ... b pier lounge was open. but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -arrived late to the gate (train not working). there was a biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the ryanairthroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). unbelievable that ryanair dispatches planes in this condition. food average. wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). overall experience 2/10. flew air france (fortalaza to cdg to lhr) two weeks earlier which was way better. how emryanairrrassing for ryanair."
362,Good,"  worst experience ever. outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified. i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip. inbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notified. on top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only ryanairg i had. extra wait in milan then. food is horrible."
363,Good,"     check in was a shambles at bwi, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. the ryanairg drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. once on board, the fas were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad. the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. i was seated in an aisle seat (row f) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful ife screens. the meal was mediocre and there was no ryanairr service before the meal this time. on lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. overall, i rate this just as a mediocre journey."
364,Good,    beyond disgusted with the fact that my ryanairggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to ryanair. two pieces reported 29th september. ryanair responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
365,Good,     london to gibraltar on 25th october 2022. i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  ryanair attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutriryanairr as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ryanair aim to be positioned at of late. the a320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. the staff disappeared for most of the flight. the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. 
366,Good,"   iâ€™ve generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ryanair if they fly the route iâ€™m after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. we should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when youâ€™ve then got an 8hr + flight. staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. they couldnâ€™t get it out and away quickly enough. that was then ryanairsically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. they were all extremely miserable and clearly didnâ€™t want to be on board. weâ€™re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march. this was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !"
367,Good,"     just a few years ago flying on ryanair was enjoyable, but times have changed. these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. the terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. on board though, itâ€™s just become an experience to be endured. ryanairâ€™s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. there is no entertainment, no magazine. refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal ryanairr. on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a ryanairg around a toilet door down the ryanairck in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. on the return flight, for one reason or another due to ryanairâ€™s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldnâ€™t travel at all because there were not enough crew. the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. altogether, i would say good things if there were any - but itâ€™s hard to think of anything i could recommend ryanair for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys."
368,Good,"     a very positive experience with ryanair. seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. food was fine but not outstanding. wi-fi good, and video screen large and bright. ryanairggage came out very quickly at heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta. all in all, would fly ryanair again, but would proryanairbly want to make sure it is new seats."
369,Good,"    ryanairby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. my second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple ryanairg of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. ryanairggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy ryanairgs had been delivered. a380 is a great aircraft but the ryanair seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (proryanairbly not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"
370,Good,"     evening flight from lhr to iad on an a380. check in at t5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. boarding was very poorly managed. the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. the flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. they did their job very professionally and efficiently. they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. they started out with a ryanairr service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. all in, it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention."
371,Good,"     while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating. i got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. "
372,Good,"   lhr-lax. i prefer the boeing 777 over the a380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was ryanairg drop and security at heathrow. t5 is a whole other story. once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t5 before. anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. the entertainment system was good with decent options, so i occupied my time with several movies. nice landing at lax. all in all ryanair was just fine."
373,Good,"     flew ryanairck to uk from miami in new club world suite - a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world. boarding easy. took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way ryanairck and landed on time. very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. bedding and large pillow supplied. attentive fa's - especially anna who addressed me by name). however, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). and, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. refused to pay ryanair's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. c'mon ryanair - do we not pay enough already to travel club class ? i can recommend ryanair's new club class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future."
374,Good,     i flew with hand ryanairggage but security at duryanairi was quick. entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. flight on a380 left on time. few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. decent snack and slept well. arrivals lounge excellent. would recommend.
375,Good,"  london to cairo. first, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny ryanairg of pretzels and a small bottle of water. even southwest is more generous. when unable to connect my phone to order food, i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour. when the fa came to collect garryanairge i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. he used his phone to place the order."
376,Good,"     this review is specifically about maddie, crew member who took care of us. she was attentive, warm, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. smiling from start to finish. she should be the brand amryanairssador for ryanair."
377,Good,"     5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainment. in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase."
378,Good,     check in at jersey straightforward. there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr. captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at heathrow. good service from the cabin crew and a ryanaircon roll and coffee served. disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t5 was as long as the flight!
379,Good,"     check in at lhr t5 was very quick and queue for security short. we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. flight boarded on time. whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. glass of champagne, coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little ryanairnter. in spite of some of the issues with ryanair, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. flight landed on time and ryanairgs delivered quite promptly."
380,Good,"    the check-in process was smooth. i got access to the iga lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge. on board was what all this flight was about. this was my first time flying intra-european business class, and though i was well prepared, i still found it underwhelming. first, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. there is no personal ife, so ryanairsically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago. i could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. also, the 32 passengers shared one single wc, meaning a long line for the ryanairth room, something i have rarely seen in business class. arrived at lhr, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. it finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since ryanair is the main operator at heathrow t5, such things will affect their reputation."
381,Good,"    this is my first time flying ryanair's new club suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. flight to the us, including mine, departed from concourse c of terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. however, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. the highlight is the club suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. i think now is the time for them to begin to get ryanairck to pre-pandemic standard. at least the food tasted good, which was not something i previously experienced on ryanair flights, even in first class."
382,Good,"     my 7am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. they did not work with me as i miss 2 days of conference. they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden (stockholm); which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice - but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself. upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure, i saw a direct flight to heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. so i changed to 8.15am from gothenburg - heathrow - jersey. however, at this point ryanair told me i have to pay a fee of gbp 710 as i â€œchanged my flight a 2nd timeâ€.  i find it a disgrace that ryanair charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. ryanair proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense. i have since contacted ryanair for the legal compensation iâ€™m entitled to according to uk law, but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination. if i have a choice, i will never travel ryanair again. such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs."
383,Good,"   i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey! i donâ€™t know how you manage to keep smiling. couldnâ€™t fault anything. helpful, reassuring, excellent food and i canâ€™t wait to fly again. thank you and i really appreciated you."
384,Good,   good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39j and lack of good leg room. meal was good from singapore. should be more snacks on board. my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didnâ€™t work.
385,Good,     flight was 1 hour late leaving gate. crew were friendly. seats comfortable. but the complimentary snack provided was a ryanairg of ready salted crisps.
386,Good,   flight was cancelled at the last minute due to â€œweatherâ€ despite pretty much all other flights not being affected. booked onto a flight the next day. arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead t5. horrendous check-in and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight. the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done.
387,Good,"     after having a few not so good experiences in the past, i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved. first of all, the improvement in the ryanair lounge in gatwick is massive. the buffet was a joy. we flew on a ryanair flight but operated by iberia express. wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! also may i add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. i am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports."
388,Good,"   this review is for ryanair booking system not a flight . today i clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. i then go to â€œcancel bookingâ€ and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way. i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didnâ€™t want. however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they canâ€™t tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they canâ€™t say when. so they now have my money and i have to re-book at full cost. in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up."
389,Good,     manchester to seattle via london. i will never fly ryanair again. they cancelled my return flight from heathrow ryanairck to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester. the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. i will not be flying ryanair again
390,Good,"     our flight in march 2022 from san francisco to london on 28th march was cancelled with 3 hoursâ€™ notice. we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. we had to stay overnight for the next day flight. we still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. it is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. during this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). this should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. we were given a voucher. this voucher was only bookable by phone. when i phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying ryanair were not taking flight bookings by phone. you can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? all i have been offered is another voucher. the time to use has passed. it must be great to be a business that can print endless a4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. we returned home with aer lingus with no drama."
391,Good,"     full afternoon flight. ready to fly on time. arrived early. uneventful flight. good service. pre dinner drinks. drink with meal. coffee, drinks available at ryanairck. avml meal was tasty. hard working crew on a full flight. audio worked well."
392,Good,"     having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, i boarded the plane on this ryanairsis. i was subsequently dumped at ryanairrcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. there was no help at there to find a hotel. i have ms and can't walk without help, ryanair did nothing, their partners iberia did nothing. at about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. i lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. ryanair insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. i would not have got on the plane had i known. i found out i could go to arbitration. ryanair now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if i do. their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is ryanaird enough. for someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers. so for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with ryanair."
393,Good,"   Â Â ryanairrryanairra collins was super helpful. my boyfriend & i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate, slightly later one. ryanairrryanairra was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together & even managed to put us sitting together! much appreciate ryanair! we had a terrific flight over. food, drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly. looking forward to returning home with ryanair."
394,Good,"   my husryanairnd, parents who are in their 80â€™s and i were traveling ryanairck to ny from naples, italy and had a stopover at heathrow, london. let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight ryanairck to ny. the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us. she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! she is so kind and is amazing at her job."
395,Good,"   on our recommendation my son and his young family (child 4 and ryanairby 9 months) and wife, flew ryanair to the usa from cape town, leaving yesterday evening. just got off the call with him, after their arrival at heathrow. shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from rsa, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. my grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it sir"", that sealed it for us, if thatâ€™s the ryanair response to whatâ€™s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate."
396,Good,"   we had a nice flight. pushed-off exactly on time. cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well. dinner (hot!) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good. do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful ryanair call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance. nice start to a 3 week trip to england."
397,Good,"     holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. at our arrival in amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at london heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when i arrived in london, the suitcase was missing, left in amsterdam. 2 suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. no compensation, no dates on when will i get my property ryanairck, no information, lies and more lies.  i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and i might receive the money ryanairck in 30 days! yes, i might."
398,Good,    despite ryanair's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the chief executive) have remained unanswered. do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises. some things just do not change at ryanair.
399,Good,"     flight on a380 sfo to lhr. smooth check in at san francisco. airport quiet and efficient. dedicated ryanair lounge, excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. lounge was very crowded though. minor departure delay and onto a380 upper deck. i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter. old style product but clean and well maintained. staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals. on time arrival, ryanairggage quite slow. a good flight overall."
400,Good,"     for this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a ryanairg of potato chips, and a bottle of water. if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. however there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. they also managed to lose my luggage.  i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. i will never use them again."
401,Neutral,"Despite little notice on our part and no insurance. We received a full refund when we needed to cancel due to losing a parent. Weren’t expecting that, thank you!"
402,Neutral,Pretty okay i mean enough space but not to comfortable seats but they were okay i drink coke and it was good i mean coke cant be bad right? For a low budget airline its a good one
403,Neutral,My flight was rather ok. The most that happened was all phones had to be switched off due to weather reasons. The most enjoyable thing about the flight had to be the lasagna (non vegan).
404,Neutral,"Ryanair market themselves as the cut price airline....and there are no frills. Seat space is limited as is communication. I also had my credit card compromised shortly after using it on the flight, not sure if it's a coincidence or not"
405,Neutral,The most terible seats ever so uncomfy causes frustration on long journeys flight crew great the seats are like first bus seats hard dont recline sat in one position takes tole on back and when fat people sit near you makes you costrafobic and anxious on 4 hour flights
406,Neutral,Quick flight from paris to barcelona thankfully not late There is always one thing that make me stress on the day of travel is the fact to do the online checkin because at the aiport it's expensive greatfully managed to do the online checkin
407,Neutral,I gave it 3 stars because the aircraft and the bathroom weren't very clean and most importantly if you don't buy seats then they will separate your child with the parents. I think this is absolutely illegal because in an emergency situation the child will panic and might do something wrong.
408,Neutral,We purchase the fast track for Ryanair for our flight from Faro to Porto and back. When going to the fast track we did not get passed it a Ryanair seems to sell this as a service but does not pay the airport for it. This is easy money for something they cannot actually sell. Pure rip off!!!
409,Neutral,"The smell was ok for a plane, the Take off was fine ,the flight was fine , and the landing was poor it felt like the plane was jumping ."
410,Neutral,"Landed on time , then sat on the plane for over 30 mins waiting for a slot to park up. Just what you want at midnight. Unacceptable."
411,Neutral,"the flight attendant is rude, he insults the passengers I understood that he is tired and that he is old, but his impudence and impertinence is unacceptable"
412,Neutral,Cross winds on take off and a hard landing but we got there safely. Professional flight attendants. I will fly with this company again when it fits my travel plans
413,Neutral,"Flight was grand , plane staff were deadly but see that little gremlin checking passports and boarding passes at gate 104 on 29 th Jan 2023 at 7am boarding , she would wanna take that stick out of her whole and breath , other than that issue , fantastic air line to fly with"
414,Neutral,"There new type planes,don’t sit at the rear as you don’t get a minute peace with cabin crew talking loud and look at you in an ignorant way,this Italian crew member sat all flight doing nothin But talking very loud.could have and should have been a good flight but that guy was very loud"
415,Neutral,"Zara on flight FR1179 you will know who you are, you let your crew down, because you dont think you have to pull you weight the same as others.
Otherwise as always Great"
416,Neutral,4 hour flight with an hour wait makes for a very uncomfortable bottom perched on the flimsiest padded seat ever. stiff neck also from the same poorly padded headreast.
417,Neutral,"Ryanair have a mixed reputation but what they do, they do reasonably well.
The priority boarding, though, is a bit of a con as almost everyone books that so they can take a cabin bag on board"
418,Neutral,Don’t waste your money paying for fast track! As there was none available at Birmingham or Dublin airports but Ryanair are happy to take your money even though the service isn’t available!!
419,Neutral,Cheap option but the chairs aren’t comfortable and the staff is constantly screaming the duty free promotions. Also light on during late hour flight (landing after midnight).
420,Neutral,All round the flight was good and arrived on time. Check in quick and boarding okay. Comfortable for what it is. Food/drink okay but as expected. Bags arrived no issue and staff are okay. Main benefit is this route is the only direct one between the UK and Genoa
421,Neutral,To offer any compensation for deyaled flight - for exapmle coffe or voucher. To inform particulary about deyaled flight in advance.
422,Neutral,"In all my flights with ryanair, there was a great delay. Last night, at Ben Gurion airport in Israel (a country you must avoid!) Ryanair decided to leave earlier. There was no announcement whatsoever. The flight boards showed open gate ""last-call"" but the plane had already left.…"
423,Neutral,"If you have at least one suitcase Ryanair turns out to be not that inexpensive. Other than that it's not bad. On time, good service."
424,Neutral,"I never have any problems with Ryanair. They are just like any other airline; if you book with them, follow their rules. The planes are clean, the pilots and crew are good which makes for a pleasant experience."
425,Neutral,"Good flight overall, but we departed quite late, while people where queuing up in settings that weren't super comfortable. The flight itself was very smooth and the return trip uneventful."
426,Neutral,"I called to Ryanair Uk customer service the person mr Ryan, failed to tell me what extra documents are required to print and bring with me on the day of flight. Should have knowledge or brief notes in front of them on current everyday changing govt rules to guide passengers."
427,Neutral,"So, as you'd expect, you get what you pay for. In fact, I ended up doing most of the work. This is what a low fare gets you I guess. I cannot say it was a short flight by any means, but it was me who had to know how to handle the landing gears. Speaking of which, only one side of the landing gear seemed to work. But, I guess, I didn't book anything else in, only the flight. Smooth take off however, straight down my knickers. Smooth landing but only thanks to the co pilot. Would I fly again? Maybe, if BA weren't available."
428,Neutral,"Cheap-ish tickets (after adding in luggage...), flight was OK - unremarkable. Aircraft fairly clean, crew OK. Carryons not checked at any point."
429,Neutral,Oi have been trying to use agift voucher for the last few days and cannot get it through the booking
430,Neutral,"Low cost airline with little customer service. You have to be very careful to avoid paying extra fees such as carrying a larger suitcase, or checking online. If you pay attention to everything, it can be cheap. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so."
431,Neutral,The check in went smoothly. I had to pay an extra for overweight; Ryanair was so precise this time... The flight was all right.
432,Neutral,The check in was really bad. There was only one person at the desk and we had to wait at least one hour. Otherwise it was just OK.
433,Neutral,"good staff, good seats, helpful onboarding staff, very helpful with us since we have a baby, they let us have a row without anyone seated next to us."
434,Neutral,"The trip was ok, a part that the plane was almost empty and we were allocated a seat where a person was already seated in our same set of 3. Not ideal considering that my partner and I were traveling with an infant and for the Covid. Eventually we asked to be seated somewhere else with more room and the hostess accommodated our request."
435,Neutral,"It looks like the waiting time to boarder are shortening. However I hate waiting outside before getting on the plain. Why do they not start the procedure a bit later to avoid us waiting outside?
A part from that cheap but good flight."
436,Neutral,Flight cancelled on the 7th July 2020 asked for a refund had a email on the 28th October saying I will get a cheque in 28 business days still waiting.
437,Neutral,Plane was not very full which is always better. Service was good. Plane was not very clean as usual. Left on time and arrived early.
438,Neutral,Ryanair have just cancelled and refunded our trip to Tenerife at the end of January. That's not a good sign. Let's see if Trip advisor is as forthcoming and refund our apartment booking in Las Americs 
439,Neutral,The airline is offering cheap tickets across multiple destinations in Europe and is delivering the quality to the price you pay.
440,Neutral,"The airline is offering cheap tickets across Europe and is delivering the quality to the price you pay. During the quarantine, my flights got cancelled but I have received refunds for all of them."
441,Neutral,"No Covid distancing. In many cases, people were packed in three to a row. Not enough insistence from staff that people wear their masks correctly: quite a few wearing them under the nose or under the chin. Did not feel safe at all."
442,Neutral,"I have flyt with this airline, I can say this is typical low cost with minimal services, but the flyt was ok without delay. Also I have booked tickets from Kyiv to Paris, but they were canceled due to COVID. After some time they propose to receive certificates or wait for refund."
443,Neutral,"On the flight to Tenerife there were strict measures in place , but return flight crew did not enforce mask protocol, numerous passengers standing in aisle with no masks on , then when in airport no health checks or documentation checks for 14 day quarantine , very much different at the Spanish airport !"
444,Neutral,"Ryanair is not probably the airline with the best quality in terms of services , customer support and comfort you could find. This time (pre covid) I found them nicer than last time but in terms of Legroomand seatcomfort they would need to do something."
445,Neutral,"The flight was ok, maybe it was a little late at night, meaning that we arrived home very late and the morning after we had to go to work. However, we had more time to enjoy the day in Sardinia. The service as usual is super loud, making it impossible to sleep."
446,Neutral,Got my refund...yeah. Was hard to arrange but was refunded back to my card last week. Not bad Ryanair
447,Neutral,"With these lowcost airlines, they have so many rules, but if you follow them you should okay.
I think they could put people next to each other when tickets are bought as part of the same PNR."
448,Neutral,Ryanair is the cheapest company to travel through Europe. Most of the times they are on time. But don´t choose them for important flies like for Christmas. If any strike or something happends is difficult to get another fly from them in the next hours.
449,Neutral,"Despite the basic comfort during a 4h30 flight, we had a very nice flight with Ryanair, and certainly during these Corona times. Flight was only half full."
450,Neutral,the airline is a means to a end its not the best but the price you pay what do you expect. take your own food onboard as there food is rubbish and over priced. the staff most of the time are good but on some occasions they think that they are doing you a favour just being there.
451,Neutral,"Typical Ryanair, as long as you stick to there policies its fine. We did not buy anything on board. Take off on time. Efficient.."
452,Neutral,"Ryanair is lowcost and so I dont think you should expect anything more than basic. The plane lands filled with people, they get out, the next bunch gets in and so on. There is no cleaning, not a lot of space, no comfort etc. Used to be ok for the price, but lately they charge…"
453,Neutral,"As always a cheap experience and never on time, but, thats normal i guess if you fly cheap. Service is not the best, its not really clean."
454,Neutral,"typical ryan air flight, delayed an hour going out, staff trying to sell stuff constantly, that's part of their job, but can be annoying. staff never seem happy on board. usual hum drum ryan air."
455,Neutral,"When I travel with ryan air I know what it will be like before I buy the ticket. If you want a premium flight do not fly with them. The plane is clean, staff polite, leg room small but overall it gets you where you want to go. I would recommend it,"
456,Neutral,"I would like to say the flight was good, and I have never had any problem with this company but sadly the steward wasn’t very helpful and he was rude. So due to this I want very happy on this occasion nothing to do with the airline just the staff"
457,Neutral,"The flight arrives on time. The seats are not confortable, you must pay more to sit next to your spouse, to have 10 kilos of luggage, ... the plane is not clend between two flights."
458,Neutral,"Good flight from Bournemouth Airport. It's a small airport so very straightforward with no hassle and no problems. The flight was on time, all went well. I would recommend the Ryanair flight to Alicante."
459,Neutral,"Don’t expect anything fancy. Board from air stairs to seat doesn’t recline, this is economy level flying. Saying that we were on time which was a bonus"
460,Neutral,"Late boarding. First we waited at the gate. Then on the stairs for 10 minutes, then on the tarmac for 5 more minutes in a cold wind several people in just dresses or shirts. service on board was slow to start girls to busy chatting to get trolley ready was 1.1/2 hours into flight before we were offered refreshments. Toilet not properly cleaned before my wife used it and she was first to do so."
461,Neutral,Free airport transfer from terminal 1 to terminal 2. Quick check-in for priority bookings. Airport assistance requested when booked. Security check was fast. Enough time to get a coffee and use the toilets (that were clean). Boarding was okay (except for the 5 minute wait…
462,Neutral,"I can't fault Ryanair, I never can! I use them often. It's cheap, but the service is always good. I mean it's not outstanding, but it is a budget airline. I ate for the 1st time on this flight and honestly the panini was lovely! Great service with it. Can't fault them."
463,Neutral,"Airport experience was good. No delays. The holiday was great, Sardinia was fabuloue, weather, people, food and drink, all excellent."
464,Neutral,"legroom was more than expected. Services is poor, but flight was on-time. I hate the commercial selling of lottery tickets"
465,Neutral,RyanAir don't refund flights even if you cancel within 1 hour of booking. Just leaving this review as a reference for other people
466,Neutral,"On time, nice flight, some of the crew were greek when we went and when we came back. This is very possitive for foreign company. But i have taken 20 kg suitcase when i had made the tickets booking for 50 euros and some other paid 40 euros for the same thing when the made check…"
467,Neutral,"As a budget airline , that is exactly what you get.Food and drinks are over priced and not very good,maximum would be 3 hours in these conditions , as it was the flight was prompt and arrived both ways early ."
468,Neutral,"It was very cheap and good value , booked in advance and was worth every penny. We also had a nice lunch in the flight staff were good"
469,Neutral,Ryanair flights are usually on time which is great. They keep changing the pricing especially on baggage which can be confusing. Our flight was fairly busy but we boarded easily. Probably too many announcements on trying to sell things but cabin staff were friendly. Costs not…
470,Neutral,"Flight out was a bit noisy
Large group of passengers quite disroptive, were asked by flight crew on a number of occasions to sit down ,they were swopping seats and talking across other passengers .
Flight back was much better"
471,Neutral,Service was good on this on this flight. Took off on time considering weather. Flight Attendants were friendly and helpful also professional. Landing however was very bumpy. I think tbh I could've landed the plane blindfolded better! Overall great value though
472,Neutral,Nowhere near the quality of other similar budget airlines. Comfort of seats poor. Food service quality very poor. Staff do their best but can't see any who looked as though they loved their jobs in comparison to other airlines I flown with. Work to do I would say Mr O'Leary!
473,Neutral,"First Time on Ryanair,The fly its good,board service not brilhant, but for a low coast its aceptable.Entertenaiment not exist."
474,Neutral,"I love flying with Ryanair because they are cheap
Overall a short flight, we took Priority and it was very convenient"
475,Neutral,They claim to be a low cost airline but it’s really not when you add in all the extras. Seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.
476,Neutral,"Basic, no thrills cheap flight, friendly attendants, neither eyebrow raising or impressive. Does what it says on the can!"
477,Neutral,"Booked a cheap flight to Prague and the flight was a typical economy flight with Ryanair.
Staff friendly but very small seats and drinks/snacks expensive but as to be expected"
478,Neutral,"Did stop flying Ryanair since Setember 2016, after our Pula visit. This time found that best and lowest ticket price to Malta was through Ryanair. Was satisfied with both flights as well as with the service received. I coud not ask for more taking in account the airfare price."
479,Neutral,"You get what you pay for, for a 3.5 hr flight I wasn’t expecting anything much. Just wanted to get to my destination in one piece which I did. If you want excellent service etc then go somewhere else and pay extra for it."
480,Neutral,Half hour late in both directions. Uncomfortable seats. Very little leg room. They did not offer me a menu book before they came round to take the orders. My tray on way back was dirty. Cheap flight with no frills
481,Neutral,Usually offers a random seat during flight which quite okey with me. They have an easy way to book and quickest claim of luggage.
482,Neutral,"Low budget airlines deliver mostly what they sell, no thrills and everything at an extra cost. This airline is no different. Plane was clean, crew was friendly and we had a smooth landing."
483,Neutral,"The 2 hours flight was well organized. The only minus, that they didn't show the blank window at 11.A.!!!"
484,Neutral,"No delays, no problems with luggage or seats went all as planned we arrived on time, so it was possible to perform all normal procedures without any kind of issues"
485,Neutral,Everything went smoothly from check in to arrival. Didn’t have anything on the plane as Ryanair are more expensive than any other airline I’ve been on. Would use them again.
486,Neutral,"Business as usual... the known advantages (price) and flaws (lack of space, lots of walking in order to reach the plane) but it gets you to your destination, no harm done! Definitely recommend if you are in a low budget, go elsewhere otherwise."
487,Neutral,"Flight ok, one way from Madrid to London, limited choices when you would like to buy something to eat."
488,Neutral,"Ryanair gets you from A to B, no frills, that's it! Have to pay extra to get a decent sized cabin luggage bag, priority or booking seats."
489,Neutral,cheap airline and cheap flights result in cheap service and reduced in air facilities we didnt mind it was a low cost getaway for a birthday celebration so no frills flight was ok
490,Neutral,Cheap and cheerful and you get what you pay for mainly run on time and they have a fast turn around seating not exactly comfortable
491,Neutral,Flight was delayed and even though i knew before getting to the airport( checked the flight from Dublin it left late) there was no information untill after our broadoing time. Other wise same as always
492,Neutral,I try not to used Ryanair because because I don’t find them cheap and they are always delays and you are packed in like sardines.
493,Neutral,"The standard and the crew were good for a low cost airline, but during the holiday season, the price was as expensive as a normal airline."
494,Neutral,"The flight was delayed for 1 hour and 15 minutes. However, the service was good and the crew at te flight really nice. Good flight overall."
495,Neutral,Engine issue resulted in a 7 hour delay. Communication was poor but in fairness compensation was very quick to be acknowledged.
496,Neutral,"As above but serve with trolley too many times, food and drink not long before landing !!?? Otherwise ok"
497,Neutral,Fly with another airline if you possibly can. I have nothing positive to say other than the flights were spot on with timing.
498,Neutral,"Check in with suitcase not that easy. Queuing at departure gate a real pain. Good idea for front and rear loading, but you loose out if you snooze re cabin bags. Lost glasses on outward leg, Ryanair staff no help."
499,Neutral,The seats are not relaxing at all. When you stay more than 30 minutes you feel very uncomfortable. Imagine about 3 hours flight!!!
500,Neutral,"Ryanair it is very simple, what you pay is what you get."
501,Neutral,"nice flight, arrived 20 min earlier. In order to sit next to your companion you have to pay extra money, otherwise they put you far away from each other"
502,Neutral,The flight with Ryanair was overall satisfactory. No major complaints.
503,Neutral,"The check-in process was smooth, and the flight departed and arrived on time."
504,Neutral,you are paying for a cheep flight yes but you are then paying a bit more for your setting leg room the priority boarding is a big joke as 80% of the flight have paid of it. Isome time think if you were a flock of sheep you would be looked after better than use customers
505,Neutral,"It's a bit annoying that they have to always walk the corridor trying to sell stuff. The perfumes are not even original, so it's a waste of money. I bought a Hugo Boss set, and one of the bottles had an unbranded box."
506,Neutral,"the journey passed very well, the staff very kind, too bad that for obvious company problems they have to turn into product sellers, making it difficult for travelers to rest."
507,Neutral,"The in-flight service was standard, nothing exceptional but met expectations."
508,Neutral,The seat was comfortable enough for the duration of the flight.
509,Neutral,In October the flight was scheduled to leave in the afternoon But broken down on tarmac resulting in a 6 to 7 hours delay the result was a claim for 4 person's So under the rules (check this out if you are delayed) we were in titled to 1000 dollars for the 4 of us Which we were…
510,Neutral,"The flight was okay, the captain and the staff informed us properly that there might be a problem with landing in Bari. And it happened, our flight was diverted to Pescara, which is 3 hours away from Bari...."
511,Neutral,I appreciate the affordable ticket prices that Ryanair offers.
512,Neutral,"Once again the plane was very dirty, plus not a lot of leg room, one of the air stewards didn't start the emergency drill until they were past the seat belt drill, drinks and snacks okay and duty free good."
513,Neutral,"The plane was very dirty, not a lot of leg room you were very squashed, duty free was good as they had products you needed, food and drinks were okay too."
514,Neutral,The cabin crew was polite and professional.
515,Neutral,Had trouble to check in online cost me and partner over £100 to get home. Not impressed.. U get what u pay for. On way out plane was dirty and not cleaned
516,Neutral,"All good, thank you for your care for our baby. It was a cosy pleasant flight with a very king personell"
517,Neutral,"The flight was punctual, and I reached my destination on time."
518,Neutral,The online booking system was easy to navigate.
519,Neutral,This is a budget Airline as as such no frills but the cabin crew are always polite and helpful. Would use this airline again but make sure you add bags/seats etc when you book as they charge extra at the airport. Also Please make sure of the size of any bags as again they are very hot anything over sized is cahrged as hold bags beware!!
520,Neutral,Average flight. Nothing to complain about really when you know what to expect from budget airlines. It's a shame they try and charge extra to sit together. Must be annoying for families with small children.
521,Neutral,"The legroom was a bit tight, but it's expected on budget airlines."
522,Neutral,The flight attendants were helpful and attentive.
523,Neutral,"You don't expect too much from Ryanair and you don't get it. The flight was on time, no delays and reasonable comfortable, What I really didn't like was having to queue and wait on the tarmac while arriving passengers left the plane and it was tidied. Fortunately it was dry (but cold). Why can't we wait"
524,Neutral,If looking to fly with Ryanair via Edinburgh airport be prepaired as we are almost looking at a self check in were you weigh your own case put on your tag take to a conveyor belt and the case us away they then also try a fleece you at the gate if you bag is too big
525,Neutral,"The flight was cost-effective, and I got value for my money."
526,Neutral,"Ryanair seems cheap, but you have to be careful about the extra fees that they charge, such as your luggage, boarding pass etc. They charge for boarding pass if you don't have one, and it is expensive, So, make sure you get your boarding pass before you go to the airport;…"
527,Neutral,"Second time of using Ryanair and overall was fine. Leg room was somewhat limited and the seat feels more like a bench. The flight left and arrived on time. No real negatives, did what it said got me to Malaga for a decent price."
528,Neutral,The overall experience was standard for a budget airline.
529,Neutral,"The flight was on schedule, and I had a smooth boarding process."
530,Neutral,The mobile app is user-friendly and helpful for managing bookings.
531,Neutral,"Really annoying that this airline deliberately splits children from adults in an attempt to make you pay more to be seated together, and then the safety announcements tell you about how to look after your child..... who presumably isn’t sitting with you..."
532,Neutral,"booked through an agent as not properly proficient booking on line as yet.so obviously paid quite a bit more.no problems , straight to departure gate and await the plane.no complaints. you get what you pay for."
533,Neutral,"Ryanair continues with it arrogant, ""take it or leave it"" attitude to Customer Service. It ""hell on earth"" trying to voice a Complaint, however valid, and then, when you finally succeed in doing so, you receive a pro forma stereo-typically worded response that, in my case,…"
534,Neutral,No issues with baggage handling; everything arrived safely.
535,Neutral,The onboard snacks were reasonably priced.
536,Neutral,The flight crew provided clear announcements and instructions.
537,Neutral,Old seats for the first time ever we could get a hot drink both ways Staff nice and pleasant . not sure would use again
538,Neutral,"OK on time, crew very good, however why oh why do they charge upwards of £7 each way just to sit by your partner, the auto allocation system seems to split people up causing mayhem on boarding as people try and sit by their partner, often in someones else seat. Its just money grabbing, OK if your single but certainly leads to customer dissatisfaction."
539,Neutral,"Packed flight, quite cheap. Got in on time. Booking can be strenuous as they are always trying to trick you into paying more. Arrived on time."
540,Neutral,"The aircraft was clean, and the facilities were well-maintained."
541,Neutral,The online check-in option is convenient and time-saving.
542,Neutral,I didn't encounter any significant delays during my journey.
543,Neutral,"Ryanair is never my first choice but the price was so much cheaper than others,we paid extra to be able to take a cabin case and a handbag,I dont know why we bothered as the line for those with hand luggage only nearly every one had at lease a small case and handbags and lots with hat boxes, one lady was stopped and asked to pay she produced a £50 note only to be told Oh go on then as we have no change."
544,Neutral,"You get what you pay for. The price is good and that's all that is good.
No legroom. De distance from the gate to the plain is 500 meters. No comfort what so ever, but hey... the price is good."
545,Neutral,"Great staff as very friendly and polite, good leg room and you can stretch and good service, Waiting time and check in needs a bit of work"
546,Neutral,"This is not our choice of airline. It was part of our package holiday. I gave it 3 stars because It was on time , the plane was clean and with attentive crew. My partner and I was not seated together and it’s against our principle to pay to sit together. On our outward bound…"
547,Neutral,Flew on a short break. Plane on time. Basic but legroom ok. Limited free hand luggage. Paid to book seats together but should have been free as assistance booked. Every extra Costa but for basic price ok.
548,Neutral,"No frills mean no frills. Seriously, no frills.Honestly, no frills. Treat this plane and airline as you would a bus, and you will not be disappointed."
549,Neutral,"From Croatia by winter a Treviso airpot is close and cheap flyght by Ryanair ,but conecetion is just Goopty or Flixbus"
550,Neutral,"Flew from Stansted to Oslo ,it went smoothly, with Ryan App it's easy to get boarding card, its cramped but Ryanair is like that"
551,Neutral,Priced to fly. Use it as I would use a bus. Gets me from A to B Use Ryanair a lot. Food and drink expensive on board. Can be noisy with stag and hen dos to Benidorm.
552,Neutral,"Flights were on time and well organised. Having travelled Ryanair before and having long legs, my son and I had booked two ""wing"" seats because of the greater leg room. The actual seats were just as ""unpadded"" and uncomfortable for a 3 and a half hour flight but the extra leg…"
553,Neutral,"Short break to Gdańsk with my daughter , flight was as expected for cheap no frills , didn’t pay for seats so were seated as far apart as possible, pathetic tactics to try and make u pay to move one seat . Cabin crew not particularly friendly ... had we had a choice would choose Easyjet every time ."
554,Neutral,OK but packed in like sardines. Very little leg room. It was a pleasure travellng from a small airport.
555,Neutral,"a very good flight with good legroom and friendly crew and comfortable flight.
good information on flight times weather and time of flight"
556,Neutral,No complaints about the onboard amenities; everything was as expected.
557,Neutral,The airline staff was courteous and addressed inquiries promptly.
558,Neutral,The flight departed and arrived without any hiccups.
559,Neutral,I appreciate the transparency in pricing with no hidden fees.
560,Neutral,The boarding process was efficient and well-organized.
561,Neutral,Staff was very polite and helpful. Wish only they clean inside of planes between flights. Good deals on off duty alcohol to take home.
562,Neutral,Flights are cheap but the luggage options and prices are very expensive... all the added extras make it an expensive flight. Treated like animals by Ryanair
563,Neutral,"£12 for a flight from Kiev to London!
This is so cheap that all the other stupid and annoying things with Ryanair become not important.
Usual boarding mess,where people who pay extra get to stand on cold stairs for 30 minutes.
The Ryanair terminal at Kiev is out of the way and a shuttle bus to get to,and has no duty free shop."
564,Neutral,Travelled from Sofia to Berlin with Ryanair. Must admit I have a soft spot for Ryanair who made flying within Europe affordable. Flights are always punctual and it is good value for your Euro.
565,Neutral,"Pleasant flight, enjoyable and timely. The on flight service is good. However the add on costs are disappointing, €28 for two seats together is sad from a company who advertises itself as a budget airline"
566,Neutral,"Its a 5 hour long flight from Dublin that arrives in at about 12am.
Everything went smoothly. There were no delays. Staff were very pleasant and helpful.
Baggage was through very quickly and we were on our way.
I would recommend this flight but would like it to arrive in earlier in the evening"
567,Neutral,Super easy flight. Got to Gothenburg in over 2 hours. My flight costed no more than £25. If you’re tall I suggest booking exit row for legroom
568,Neutral,"The checking was quick as they have many desks and personnel. The seats with extra space, fast track, priority boarding, and extra luggage need to be paid before you do the checking. Everything inside you pay. If you want to eat or drink, it is better to buy before boarding,"
569,Neutral,Not as cheap as you think after paying for priority then sitting together not as cheap and not much space between seats . Would use on short haul if under 3 hours but definitely not over that time period
570,Neutral,The flight attendants were friendly and provided good service.
571,Neutral,"Pretty basic. If it was legal to put the luggage literally on us , this would have been applied already."
572,Neutral,"Flight slightly delayed in both directions. Window seat very cramped but hadn’t paid for extra legroom, flight very hot, didn’t purchase anything on the flight but felt like a non stop sales pitch"
573,Neutral,We were discouraged from the extra expenses of the baggage. They will try to get money form everything else. Plus it may be a delay on these flights. Try to travel with light baggage.
574,Neutral,"Good short flight. But I will discourage for the extra expenses of the baggage. It might be cheap but they will try to get money form everything else. So, be careful. Plus it may be a delay on these flights."
575,Neutral,"Both flights entries not diciplined. Older people and passengers with children were not invited to board first. Passengers with seats in the rear should enter first, which was not the case."
576,Neutral,Excellent low cost option when traveling within the EU. Priority seating is an option which allow you to board first but everyone seemed to select this option so it was still a long line.
577,Neutral,"The same as ever, does what it says - cheap flights from A TO B! Takes 2 hours after landing for circulation to return to my bum the seats are so hard!"
578,Neutral,"good company,good planes,good pilots,accurate,fully loaded.sometime travelling fm difficult places.try day flights better."
579,Neutral,We flew Ryanair to Malaga Spain from Manchester in November 19. We boarded the plane to be told we need to taxi to a remote part of runway to wait an hour for a takeoff slot! Why? Airplanes aren’t the comfiest places to wait an hour. Could we not wait in the terminal? Return…
580,Neutral,"2.5 hour delay outbound, Ryanair pilot claimed it was due to a incoming passenger exiting the wrong way. He blamed the airport authorities for the delay , security issues.
Either way this also impacted on our transfer from airport to our accommodation, not a good start. At least it ave the staff plenty of time to get the plane cleaned so that was a plus!"
581,Neutral,Flight left on time and returned on time. The air fare was reasonably priced. Didn't purchase anything on board. It is annoying that when checking in 2 passengers that they are deliberately not seated together - otherwise could not fault anything.
582,Neutral,"So much for ‘priority’ boarding - complete free for all. Terribly slow and badly organised boarding. Stewards look like they are teenagers, no control over people staying on their phones at take off or landing. It’s 12 years since I’ve flown Ryanair and I hope it’ll be at…"
583,Neutral,"The aircraft was clean, and hygiene measures were in place."
584,Neutral,The flight crew handled situations professionally.
585,Neutral,The check-in process was straightforward and quick.
586,Neutral,Definitely the typical value for money . But very strict on hand luggage in comparison to other airlines . Practically allows you nothing . But there wasn’t any other major issues.
587,Neutral,"Quite used to the Ryanair process so know what to expect. On these flights, the in air crew were fine, usual services and all went to plan. Ground staff in Madrid were not very professional, long queue to check bags and not all desks being serviced. In fact one of the desks had…"
588,Neutral,"Flight left late but made up during flight. Landed on time. Food was edible. Service friendly. Not much legroom and seat not very comfortable. But this is to be expected on a budget airline. Saved some money on the tickets, so no reason to complain. If I wanted more comfort it…"
589,Neutral,"ryanair are always on time if they are going to be late then they cancel that flight so they don't have to pay delayed charges, the plain is really basic no frills at all and one ounze over your baggage limit and you get charged £11 per kilo over, i got stung both ways, you…"
590,Neutral,"Straightforward trip. Check-in easy....wait to get through security was ridiculous. Passengers remarkably calm and patient.Boarding fine, although passengers really must get organised prior to boarding so they can sit down and the plane doesn't miss its slot. Polite efficient staff. Dis-embarcation orderly and walk to baggage collection welcome after sitting for a couple of hours. It's a budget airline that got us there safely without frills.That's the model. Return trip fine, even got in a bit early."
591,Neutral,Why do they start checking people in at the gate only to have them standing in a line in a cold queue waiting to board the aircraft
592,Neutral,"everything you have to handle exactly in advance otherwise you pay, luggage is terrible, if you do not pay them under your seat, another airline forbids you for security reasons - evacuation and the like.
space is also not much
plus is the price"
593,Neutral,"Good flight, good weather, good flight attendants. Everything went as it was supposed to go, so I have to congratulate the persons involved."
594,Neutral,"Two things really annoying about Ryanair . 1 “Ready for boarding”.... no it is not if it were we would but we are not allowed too so why lie to your customers ? 2 “ Sit back and enjoy the flight “ ..... no what are very uncomfortable seats anyway do not in any way recline . In my review I rated legroom as excellent, because I paid a lot for it. In flight entertainment got terrible, unfair as there is none ."
595,Neutral,"very friendly. From pisa back to belgium some difficulties with out checked in bag, didn't hear them calling us at the gate for it altough we were sitting at the gate for 1 hour and a half.But quickly resolved and still made our flight"
596,Neutral,"OK, whenever you pay less than 100€ for your trip it will bring you where ever you need. No hassle this time with my bag pack and lucky because I got the first raw seat."
597,Neutral,"I use this flight fairly regularly and it does what it needs to, it is generally on time or occasionally early. I travel very light as the baggage allowance is limited unless you pay extra. The staff are all very pleasant in my experience. It is a strictly no frills airline and as long as you remember that it is ok."

600,Neutral,"The flight was okay. Enough leg room, just didnt like service that much. For the price i couldnt ask for more."
