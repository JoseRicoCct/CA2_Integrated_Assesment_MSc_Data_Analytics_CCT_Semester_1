1,Excellent,"Flight was on time, aircraft clean, very good crew, good leg room for an hour flight, smooth and good information from the cockpit and cabin crew. Paid £98 return, and was sucked into paying for a window seat at the front by communications from Ryanair before I travelled, classic ancillary revenue emails, and they worked!! I had a fare that permitted one cabin bag and one check-in bag, looking at the cost of the same on BA/EI the saving was massive, and to be honest for an hour who cares what food and drink you have to buy!! Well done Ryanair, def use you again, most impressed."
2,Excellent,"Great value flight at the right time from the local airport, staff are always friendly and helpful and it suits our needs, nothing wrong with that."
3,Excellent,"We fly with this airline regularly and couldn’t fault them. The staff are very courteous and friendly, the flights are usually on time, we’ve never had any issues with getting a compensation after a couple of delayed flights. Our recent flights to/from Madeira arrived on time, we felt very safe with the skilled captain - Madeira airport can be tricky, however, the landing was smooth."
4,Excellent,"I recently flew with Ryanair, and I was impressed by the overall experience. The airline offers a no-frills, cost-effective option for travel without compromising on efficiency. The booking process was straightforward, and their commitment to punctuality was evident throughout my journey."
5,Excellent,"The cabin crew was professional and friendly, making the flight enjoyable. Despite the affordable prices, the seating was comfortable enough for the duration of the flight. The airline's dedication to keeping costs low is reflected in their transparent pricing model, allowing passengers to tailor their experience according to their needs."
6,Excellent,"While additional amenities may come at an extra cost, I appreciate the flexibility this provides for travelers who prioritize budget-friendly options. Overall, Ryanair provides a reliable and economical choice for those looking to travel without breaking the bank."
7,Excellent,"I travel very often with Ryanair and it is a very reliable airline. 90% of the time there are small or no delays. On the airplane the legroom is very often bigger than of some regular cost airlines. Meal is not included in the price , but many regular cost airlines are offering also nothing (like TAP Portugal) or something completely tasteless. In reality you get with 50% lower price almost the same service as the average airlines.This flight from Thessaloniki to Stockholm was also a pleasant experience just as usual, with a very cheap price. Value for money airlines."
8,Excellent,"Having been a regular customer with Ryanair ove the years, I know what to expect, you get what you pay for, no bells and whistles!
It's convenient and cheap with very few problems.
Our flight was as comfortable as it could be and even got us there 30 mins early, so can't complain.
If you want something fancier than go elsewhere, it's a budget airline and that's exactly what you get."
9,Excellent,"We flew to Berlin and back with Ryanair. We couldn’t fault them. They were punctual, well organised and the cabin crew were lovely. A positive flying experience."
10,Excellent,"Excellent value for money. It’s basic, no frills & great for short flights. Service was great - on time, staff were nice & friendly & it was clean.

38,Excellent,A member of staff was able to move my seat so me and my partner could sit together! Ryanair said gay rights
39,Excellent,"Ryanair is a budget airline, you get what you pay for. Flight from Cologne to Stansted left on time and landed early. Cabin crew was friendly. No complaints whatsoever."
40,Excellent,"Yet another cheap and cheerful flight this time to Porto, in my opinion you cannot beat Ryanair for value and choice of destinations."
41,Excellent,"Thank you for a great trip with nice people around :) Great chat!
Very good service and hope to meet soon for another good long chat in the sky…"
42,Excellent,"The online check in by the app was really good. Quick boarding with nice staff and good service. Im absolutely going with Ryanair again, this was my first time ever with them."
43,Excellent,"Checked in online so straight through security, staff were friendly at the gate and on board. Flight was on time and everything went smoothly."
44,Excellent,The seats are extremely comfortable and the flight attendants are extremely kind. I would really recommend this airline as it’s really cheap and fun to fly.
45,Excellent,Great job. Everything was perfect. Flight was very smooth and fast. Service okay we got what we asked for. Great service for price what we paid
46,Excellent,Ive been flying with Ryanair since 2015 and had no problems at all. The cabin crew is usually friendly and everything is good everytime I fly with them
47,Excellent,"Lisbon to Birmingham, yet another cheap flight with this carrier, flight a little delayed but not an issue, aircraft was clean and tidy and staff were efficient in what they were doing."
48,Excellent,"Booked many flights with ryanair over the past years, always very happy with their handling and service"
49,Excellent,"Excellent airline, I haven't flown with them in a long time. Flights were on time, boarding was seamless. Significantly better than other low-cost companies that operate from Sofia Airport."
50,Excellent,Excellent airline and now with new app it is very easy to use I like Ryanair and as long as I have money in my pocket well card I will travel with them staff very Friendly also
51,Very_Good,"Got what u paid for, terrible queues but landed safe, can’t fault it. Friendly enough staff would recommend"
52,Very_Good,Ryanair is a very good airline.Dont understand the hate that comes from people.Their landings although sometimes are pretty rough most of the times in my experience have been fine.Very cheap.My only problem is that the legroom is a bit tight.Would recommend!!
53,Very_Good,"The flight was okay, we were late only a few minutes, the legroom was enough for this short flight, but the seats are really uncomfortable.
For this price, I think it was perfect"
54,Very_Good,The flight and cabin crew went as planned with no fuss or delays. Plane was clean and the cabin crew were very friendly.
55,Very_Good,"I had a flight on 6 June 2023, but the flight was cancelled because of the French air was on strike, but Ryanair rebooked me for 7 June 2023. On the was back 14 June 2023. The plane was comfortable for the two and half journey. It all we very smoothly, the only downside was when the flight was cancelled it had taken 36 minutes to get in touch with Ryanair, but when I did they were very helpful."
56,Very_Good,It was are first time flighting with Ryanair the plane was clean and the service was good the only thing what was wrong with it was the coffee was horrible we didn't try the food but we was told that the food is as well
57,Very_Good,Yet another cheap and cheerful flight if you are okay with a couple of inconveniences like changing the outgoing flight time from early morning to evening and a delay of 60 mins on the way back just take it in your stride.
58,Very_Good,"I had a great experience when flying with Ryanair. however, stop overbooking flights. Other than that staff are friendly. Great TIk Tok page aswell love the content"
59,Very_Good,"You know what you're getting when booking.
The prices are repeated through out the booking process.
On time flight's,in fact we were slow at the airport for boarding."
60,Very_Good,"All was ok and had a good journey.
Staff pleasant and well organised.
A few moaning British, having to pay extra for luggage at the gate ( trying to be clever), customers are prewarned."
61,Very_Good,On behalf of my mother I want to say Thank you to flight attendant August Sebastjan Richter for being helpful on flight with heavy hand luggage.
62,Very_Good,Took a flight from Birmingham to Dublin. Cheap flights you get what you pay for. Ok for a short flight but not very comfortable for a flight over a few hours. Staff very friendly.
63,Very_Good,Very good staff but very limited legroom and arm room but that's what you expect when you fly a low-budget airline. Very smooth flight with not much turbulence and very nice staff
64,Very_Good,Can't fault Ryanair. Both flights took off on time and leg room in row 7 was better than expected. Crew were more professional than my previous experience flying with Ryanair. Didn't fly with luggage so that may have helped.
65,Very_Good,Usually avoid cheap no frill airlines but Ryanair is getting better and I couldn’t fault this flight either. Great crew and the process was without issues. Great price too!
66,Very_Good,"As usual with Ryanair the service is fairly basic but, if you don’t go for their extras most flights can be quite cheap. It’s what it says on tin, a budget airline with no frills. Food and drinks however are mighty expensive, take a sandwich with you!"
67,Very_Good,"In the past I have had some rubbish experiences with Ryanair. However, on this occasion I was impressed despite some small delays. Clearly has improved since I last used them."
68,Very_Good,Very smooth both at the airport and the flight so far. Very good to see! Well done much appreciated after the issues this summer.
69,Very_Good,Very smooth both at the airport and the flight so far. Very good to see! Well done much appreciated after the issues this summer.
70,Very_Good,"Ryanair flights both ways were on time, clean and tidy with good cabin crew staff. You know what you are going to get with Ryanair (you generally get what you pay for) so was a good taxi ride!"
71,Very_Good,"Check in and security very quick,boarding a bit chaotic but like many flights these days,onboard leg room was ok,staff friendly,pre ordered pizza and chips for kids,Thai green curry and rice for adults,all were great,arrived on time,baggage delivered quickly,all in all a very good flight"
72,Very_Good,I was on a flight to Tenerife just today and the service was absolutely amazing. The airline itself isn't the best and we had a terrible experience once before but on this flight the stewardesses were very helpful and welcoming.The way there was very enjoyable.
73,Very_Good,"Absolutely smooth service on this occasion. No delays, no issues with luggage. Courteous and friendly cabin crew."
74,Very_Good,"With priority it all went well, even that the majority of the patients seem to have had it. Plane was not full. The meal deal was really OK for this type of flight. Very friendly and efficient crew.
What a difference with the flight back...."
75,Very_Good,Very friendly and helpful cabin crew and excellent flight captain. A nice experience without problems
76,Very_Good,"We found our flight from Ancona to London Stansted was ok, check in ok, boarding ok, flight ok. Only problem was people turning up with PPF2 masks, and extra luggage they had not checked in."
77,Very_Good,"I travelled return to Malaga, it was my first time flying with this company. I had a very good expeirience for each journey, Very polite and pleasant staff."
78,Very_Good,"Cheap but quality travel, Its really budget airline so its just a bus with wings. Plane was cheap, seats were comfortable, landing was hard, but thats their tradition."
79,Very_Good,"Amazing but the landings are quite hard and feel bumpy.The food is really good though.However,I recommend this plane.We have traveled to Portugal this February but our flight was delayed by 20 minutes."
80,Very_Good,"This was a great airline with great prices, except if you don't understand there baggage policies. You will get hit with high extra fees if you have not paid for enough baggage."
81,Very_Good,"Many people say that the company is not good. In my opinion, it is one of the best low cost airlines. To be able to fly for less than 15€ was unthinkable years ago."
82,Very_Good,"Good service, pleasant flight, but if you're a tall individual (like me), I'd recommend spending a bit more and choosing a seat with extra legroom! Overall very good value for money."
83,Very_Good,Not bad for a low cost company - few things can be improved but overall it's been pleasant to fly with them
84,Very_Good,"It was my second time flying with this airline and I had a really good flight. Although it was very foggy in Tenerife, the flight departed on time."
85,Very_Good,"Good experience after all, no delays. Check-in was fast at both airports and customer service was good."
86,Very_Good,"On time, polite ground handling staff, covid precautions taken, clen aircraft. No so comfy seats, but ok. Stewardesses didn make too many anouncements on board. Value for money"
87,Very_Good,Incredible to say but Michael O'Leary must have changed his stance on his Master's in Rudeness. The staff are actually very friendly and helpful! Congratulations.
88,Very_Good,been using ryan air for 5 yrs and always been calm and safe. sometimes their are some rude staff on the airplane but i just choose to ignore. But so far been very content
89,Very_Good,I like Ryanair give them a chance no deaths on Ryanair which is very good I love their new seat designe it's good and that nice food oh cmon give Ryanair a try please.
90,Very_Good,The 2 hour flight was pleasant with no surprises. It was quick and comfy with friendly staff. I would continually recommend this airline for short distances.
91,Very_Good,"I travelled after lockdown, they have a super offer and the plane was almost empty. So I have enough space, and I feel safe keeping security distance."
92,Very_Good,"Cheap but effectively revolutionised air travel in Europe. As much as people complain, they continued to travel and enjoy cheap holidays"
93,Very_Good,"Great airline, had a very comfortable flight , arrived in time and staff were great, anything we needed they were there"
94,Very_Good,Managed to go back home to visit my family with no problems at all. Friendly staff and good customer service for the whole trip.
95,Very_Good,The outbound and inbound flights were both on time. Cabin service was ok with no frills as expected. We had paid for exit seats so plenty of leg room. Every possible addition has a charge attached but all in all it was ok.
96,Very_Good,Brilliant flight on Ryanair flight was on time the service was great all amazing totally recommend
97,Very_Good,Good value and they seemed to have restricted the premium sell out to allow everyone that had a suitcase to go into the overhead locker which queueing up I was not convinced but worked well.
98,Very_Good,"Cheap airline with fast check in. No need to print out ticket, just use the Ryanair apps and your boarding pass is there. Staff is friendly."
99,Very_Good,Flew from Liverpool with another couple for my 50th Birthday.. First time with Ryanair had no complaints.
100,Very_Good,"Plane not full. Staff warm and welcoming. The whole experience was simply straightforward and easy. Great value for money. You've set the bar, looking forward to the next flight, don't let me down."
101,Average,"Despite little notice on our part and no insurance. We received a full refund when we needed to cancel due to losing a parent. Weren’t expecting that, thank you!"
102,Average,Pretty okay i mean enough space but not to comfortable seats but they were okay i drink coke and it was good i mean coke cant be bad right? For a low budget airline its a good one
103,Average,My flight was rather ok. The most that happened was all phones had to be switched off due to weather reasons. The most enjoyable thing about the flight had to be the lasagna (non vegan).
104,Average,"Ryanair market themselves as the cut price airline....and there are no frills. Seat space is limited as is communication. I also had my credit card compromised shortly after using it on the flight, not sure if it's a coincidence or not"
105,Average,The most terible seats ever so uncomfy causes frustration on long journeys flight crew great the seats are like first bus seats hard dont recline sat in one position takes tole on back and when fat people sit near you makes you costrafobic and anxious on 4 hour flights
106,Average,Quick flight from paris to barcelona thankfully not late There is always one thing that make me stress on the day of travel is the fact to do the online checkin because at the aiport it's expensive greatfully managed to do the online checkin
107,Average,I gave it 3 stars because the aircraft and the bathroom weren't very clean and most importantly if you don't buy seats then they will separate your child with the parents. I think this is absolutely illegal because in an emergency situation the child will panic and might do something wrong.
108,Average,We purchase the fast track for Ryanair for our flight from Faro to Porto and back. When going to the fast track we did not get passed it a Ryanair seems to sell this as a service but does not pay the airport for it. This is easy money for something they cannot actually sell. Pure rip off!!!
109,Average,"The smell was ok for a plane, the Take off was fine ,the flight was fine , and the landing was poor it felt like the plane was jumping ."
110,Average,"Landed on time , then sat on the plane for over 30 mins waiting for a slot to park up. Just what you want at midnight. Unacceptable."
111,Average,"the flight attendant is rude, he insults the passengers I understood that he is tired and that he is old, but his impudence and impertinence is unacceptable"
112,Average,Cross winds on take off and a hard landing but we got there safely. Professional flight attendants. I will fly with this company again when it fits my travel plans
113,Average,"Flight was grand , plane staff were deadly but see that little gremlin checking passports and boarding passes at gate 104 on 29 th Jan 2023 at 7am boarding , she would wanna take that stick out of her whole and breath , other than that issue , fantastic air line to fly with"
114,Average,"There new type planes,don’t sit at the rear as you don’t get a minute peace with cabin crew talking loud and look at you in an ignorant way,this Italian crew member sat all flight doing nothin But talking very loud.could have and should have been a good flight but that guy was very loud"
115,Average,"Zara on flight FR1179 you will know who you are, you let your crew down, because you dont think you have to pull you weight the same as others.
Otherwise as always Great"
116,Average,4 hour flight with an hour wait makes for a very uncomfortable bottom perched on the flimsiest padded seat ever. stiff neck also from the same poorly padded headreast.
117,Average,"Ryanair have a mixed reputation but what they do, they do reasonably well.
The priority boarding, though, is a bit of a con as almost everyone books that so they can take a cabin bag on board"
118,Average,Don’t waste your money paying for fast track! As there was none available at Birmingham or Dublin airports but Ryanair are happy to take your money even though the service isn’t available!!
119,Average,Cheap option but the chairs aren’t comfortable and the staff is constantly screaming the duty free promotions. Also light on during late hour flight (landing after midnight).
120,Average,All round the flight was good and arrived on time. Check in quick and boarding okay. Comfortable for what it is. Food/drink okay but as expected. Bags arrived no issue and staff are okay. Main benefit is this route is the only direct one between the UK and Genoa
121,Average,To offer any compensation for deyaled flight - for exapmle coffe or voucher. To inform particulary about deyaled flight in advance.
122,Average,"In all my flights with ryanair, there was a great delay. Last night, at Ben Gurion airport in Israel (a country you must avoid!) Ryanair decided to leave earlier. There was no announcement whatsoever. The flight boards showed open gate ""last-call"" but the plane had already left.…"
123,Average,"If you have at least one suitcase Ryanair turns out to be not that inexpensive. Other than that it's not bad. On time, good service."
124,Average,"I never have any problems with Ryanair. They are just like any other airline; if you book with them, follow their rules. The planes are clean, the pilots and crew are good which makes for a pleasant experience."
125,Average,"Good flight overall, but we departed quite late, while people where queuing up in settings that weren't super comfortable. The flight itself was very smooth and the return trip uneventful."
126,Average,"I called to Ryanair Uk customer service the person mr Ryan, failed to tell me what extra documents are required to print and bring with me on the day of flight. Should have knowledge or brief notes in front of them on current everyday changing govt rules to guide passengers."
127,Average,"So, as you'd expect, you get what you pay for. In fact, I ended up doing most of the work. This is what a low fare gets you I guess. I cannot say it was a short flight by any means, but it was me who had to know how to handle the landing gears. Speaking of which, only one side of the landing gear seemed to work. But, I guess, I didn't book anything else in, only the flight. Smooth take off however, straight down my knickers. Smooth landing but only thanks to the co pilot. Would I fly again? Maybe, if BA weren't available."
128,Average,"Cheap-ish tickets (after adding in luggage...), flight was OK - unremarkable. Aircraft fairly clean, crew OK. Carryons not checked at any point."
129,Average,Oi have been trying to use agift voucher for the last few days and cannot get it through the booking
130,Average,"Low cost airline with little customer service. You have to be very careful to avoid paying extra fees such as carrying a larger suitcase, or checking online. If you pay attention to everything, it can be cheap. I have used it for many years and will continue to do so."
131,Average,The check in went smoothly. I had to pay an extra for overweight; Ryanair was so precise this time... The flight was all right.
132,Average,The check in was really bad. There was only one person at the desk and we had to wait at least one hour. Otherwise it was just OK.
133,Average,"good staff, good seats, helpful onboarding staff, very helpful with us since we have a baby, they let us have a row without anyone seated next to us."
134,Average,"The trip was ok, a part that the plane was almost empty and we were allocated a seat where a person was already seated in our same set of 3. Not ideal considering that my partner and I were traveling with an infant and for the Covid. Eventually we asked to be seated somewhere else with more room and the hostess accommodated our request."
135,Average,"It looks like the waiting time to boarder are shortening. However I hate waiting outside before getting on the plain. Why do they not start the procedure a bit later to avoid us waiting outside?
A part from that cheap but good flight."
136,Average,Flight cancelled on the 7th July 2020 asked for a refund had a email on the 28th October saying I will get a cheque in 28 business days still waiting.
137,Average,Plane was not very full which is always better. Service was good. Plane was not very clean as usual. Left on time and arrived early.
138,Average,Ryanair have just cancelled and refunded our trip to Tenerife at the end of January. That's not a good sign. Let's see if Trip advisor is as forthcoming and refund our apartment booking in Las Americs 
139,Average,The airline is offering cheap tickets across multiple destinations in Europe and is delivering the quality to the price you pay.
140,Average,"The airline is offering cheap tickets across Europe and is delivering the quality to the price you pay. During the quarantine, my flights got cancelled but I have received refunds for all of them."
141,Average,"No Covid distancing. In many cases, people were packed in three to a row. Not enough insistence from staff that people wear their masks correctly: quite a few wearing them under the nose or under the chin. Did not feel safe at all."
142,Average,"I have flyt with this airline, I can say this is typical low cost with minimal services, but the flyt was ok without delay. Also I have booked tickets from Kyiv to Paris, but they were canceled due to COVID. After some time they propose to receive certificates or wait for refund."
143,Average,"On the flight to Tenerife there were strict measures in place , but return flight crew did not enforce mask protocol, numerous passengers standing in aisle with no masks on , then when in airport no health checks or documentation checks for 14 day quarantine , very much different at the Spanish airport !"
144,Average,"Ryanair is not probably the airline with the best quality in terms of services , customer support and comfort you could find. This time (pre covid) I found them nicer than last time but in terms of Legroomand seatcomfort they would need to do something."
145,Average,"The flight was ok, maybe it was a little late at night, meaning that we arrived home very late and the morning after we had to go to work. However, we had more time to enjoy the day in Sardinia. The service as usual is super loud, making it impossible to sleep."
146,Average,Got my refund...yeah. Was hard to arrange but was refunded back to my card last week. Not bad Ryanair
147,Average,"With these lowcost airlines, they have so many rules, but if you follow them you should okay.
I think they could put people next to each other when tickets are bought as part of the same PNR."
148,Average,Ryanair is the cheapest company to travel through Europe. Most of the times they are on time. But don´t choose them for important flies like for Christmas. If any strike or something happends is difficult to get another fly from them in the next hours.
149,Average,"Despite the basic comfort during a 4h30 flight, we had a very nice flight with Ryanair, and certainly during these Corona times. Flight was only half full."
150,Average,the airline is a means to a end its not the best but the price you pay what do you expect. take your own food onboard as there food is rubbish and over priced. the staff most of the time are good but on some occasions they think that they are doing you a favour just being there.
151,Average,"Typical Ryanair, as long as you stick to there policies its fine. We did not buy anything on board. Take off on time. Efficient.."
152,Average,"Ryanair is lowcost and so I dont think you should expect anything more than basic. The plane lands filled with people, they get out, the next bunch gets in and so on. There is no cleaning, not a lot of space, no comfort etc. Used to be ok for the price, but lately they charge…"
153,Average,"As always a cheap experience and never on time, but, thats normal i guess if you fly cheap. Service is not the best, its not really clean."
154,Average,"typical ryan air flight, delayed an hour going out, staff trying to sell stuff constantly, that's part of their job, but can be annoying. staff never seem happy on board. usual hum drum ryan air."
155,Average,"When I travel with ryan air I know what it will be like before I buy the ticket. If you want a premium flight do not fly with them. The plane is clean, staff polite, leg room small but overall it gets you where you want to go. I would recommend it,"
156,Average,"I would like to say the flight was good, and I have never had any problem with this company but sadly the steward wasn’t very helpful and he was rude. So due to this I want very happy on this occasion nothing to do with the airline just the staff"
157,Average,"The flight arrives on time. The seats are not confortable, you must pay more to sit next to your spouse, to have 10 kilos of luggage, ... the plane is not clend between two flights."
158,Average,"Good flight from Bournemouth Airport. It's a small airport so very straightforward with no hassle and no problems. The flight was on time, all went well. I would recommend the Ryanair flight to Alicante."
159,Average,"Don’t expect anything fancy. Board from air stairs to seat doesn’t recline, this is economy level flying. Saying that we were on time which was a bonus"
160,Average,"Late boarding. First we waited at the gate. Then on the stairs for 10 minutes, then on the tarmac for 5 more minutes in a cold wind several people in just dresses or shirts. service on board was slow to start girls to busy chatting to get trolley ready was 1.1/2 hours into flight before we were offered refreshments. Toilet not properly cleaned before my wife used it and she was first to do so."
161,Average,Free airport transfer from terminal 1 to terminal 2. Quick check-in for priority bookings. Airport assistance requested when booked. Security check was fast. Enough time to get a coffee and use the toilets (that were clean). Boarding was okay (except for the 5 minute wait…
162,Average,"I can't fault Ryanair, I never can! I use them often. It's cheap, but the service is always good. I mean it's not outstanding, but it is a budget airline. I ate for the 1st time on this flight and honestly the panini was lovely! Great service with it. Can't fault them."
163,Average,"Airport experience was good. No delays. The holiday was great, Sardinia was fabuloue, weather, people, food and drink, all excellent."
164,Average,"legroom was more than expected. Services is poor, but flight was on-time. I hate the commercial selling of lottery tickets"
165,Average,RyanAir don't refund flights even if you cancel within 1 hour of booking. Just leaving this review as a reference for other people
166,Average,"On time, nice flight, some of the crew were greek when we went and when we came back. This is very possitive for foreign company. But i have taken 20 kg suitcase when i had made the tickets booking for 50 euros and some other paid 40 euros for the same thing when the made check…"
167,Average,"As a budget airline , that is exactly what you get.Food and drinks are over priced and not very good,maximum would be 3 hours in these conditions , as it was the flight was prompt and arrived both ways early ."
168,Average,"It was very cheap and good value , booked in advance and was worth every penny. We also had a nice lunch in the flight staff were good"
169,Average,Ryanair flights are usually on time which is great. They keep changing the pricing especially on baggage which can be confusing. Our flight was fairly busy but we boarded easily. Probably too many announcements on trying to sell things but cabin staff were friendly. Costs not…
170,Average,"Flight out was a bit noisy
Large group of passengers quite disroptive, were asked by flight crew on a number of occasions to sit down ,they were swopping seats and talking across other passengers .
Flight back was much better"
171,Average,Service was good on this on this flight. Took off on time considering weather. Flight Attendants were friendly and helpful also professional. Landing however was very bumpy. I think tbh I could've landed the plane blindfolded better! Overall great value though
172,Average,Nowhere near the quality of other similar budget airlines. Comfort of seats poor. Food service quality very poor. Staff do their best but can't see any who looked as though they loved their jobs in comparison to other airlines I flown with. Work to do I would say Mr O'Leary!
173,Average,"First Time on Ryanair,The fly its good,board service not brilhant, but for a low coast its aceptable.Entertenaiment not exist."
174,Average,"I love flying with Ryanair because they are cheap
Overall a short flight, we took Priority and it was very convenient"
175,Average,They claim to be a low cost airline but it’s really not when you add in all the extras. Seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.
176,Average,"Basic, no thrills cheap flight, friendly attendants, neither eyebrow raising or impressive. Does what it says on the can!"
177,Average,"Booked a cheap flight to Prague and the flight was a typical economy flight with Ryanair.
Staff friendly but very small seats and drinks/snacks expensive but as to be expected"
178,Average,"Did stop flying Ryanair since Setember 2016, after our Pula visit. This time found that best and lowest ticket price to Malta was through Ryanair. Was satisfied with both flights as well as with the service received. I coud not ask for more taking in account the airfare price."
179,Average,"You get what you pay for, for a 3.5 hr flight I wasn’t expecting anything much. Just wanted to get to my destination in one piece which I did. If you want excellent service etc then go somewhere else and pay extra for it."
180,Average,Half hour late in both directions. Uncomfortable seats. Very little leg room. They did not offer me a menu book before they came round to take the orders. My tray on way back was dirty. Cheap flight with no frills
181,Average,Usually offers a random seat during flight which quite okey with me. They have an easy way to book and quickest claim of luggage.
182,Average,"Low budget airlines deliver mostly what they sell, no thrills and everything at an extra cost. This airline is no different. Plane was clean, crew was friendly and we had a smooth landing."
183,Average,"The 2 hours flight was well organized. The only minus, that they didn't show the blank window at 11.A.!!!"
184,Average,"No delays, no problems with luggage or seats went all as planned we arrived on time, so it was possible to perform all normal procedures without any kind of issues"
185,Average,Everything went smoothly from check in to arrival. Didn’t have anything on the plane as Ryanair are more expensive than any other airline I’ve been on. Would use them again.
186,Average,"Business as usual... the known advantages (price) and flaws (lack of space, lots of walking in order to reach the plane) but it gets you to your destination, no harm done! Definitely recommend if you are in a low budget, go elsewhere otherwise."
187,Average,"Flight ok, one way from Madrid to London, limited choices when you would like to buy something to eat."
188,Average,"Ryanair gets you from A to B, no frills, that's it! Have to pay extra to get a decent sized cabin luggage bag, priority or booking seats."
189,Average,cheap airline and cheap flights result in cheap service and reduced in air facilities we didnt mind it was a low cost getaway for a birthday celebration so no frills flight was ok
190,Average,Cheap and cheerful and you get what you pay for mainly run on time and they have a fast turn around seating not exactly comfortable
191,Average,Flight was delayed and even though i knew before getting to the airport( checked the flight from Dublin it left late) there was no information untill after our broadoing time. Other wise same as always
192,Average,I try not to used Ryanair because because I don’t find them cheap and they are always delays and you are packed in like sardines.
193,Average,"The standard and the crew were good for a low cost airline, but during the holiday season, the price was as expensive as a normal airline."
194,Average,"The flight was delayed for 1 hour and 15 minutes. However, the service was good and the crew at te flight really nice. Good flight overall."
195,Average,Engine issue resulted in a 7 hour delay. Communication was poor but in fairness compensation was very quick to be acknowledged.
196,Average,"As above but serve with trolley too many times, food and drink not long before landing !!?? Otherwise ok"
197,Average,Fly with another airline if you possibly can. I have nothing positive to say other than the flights were spot on with timing.
198,Average,"Check in with suitcase not that easy. Queuing at departure gate a real pain. Good idea for front and rear loading, but you loose out if you snooze re cabin bags. Lost glasses on outward leg, Ryanair staff no help."
199,Average,The seats are not relaxing at all. When you stay more than 30 minutes you feel very uncomfortable. Imagine about 3 hours flight!!!
200,Average,"Ryanair it is very simple, what you pay is what you get."
201,Poor,"Not on time. Not to destination or back home. Get the posibility to freze outside while your getting hold back from bording. Or just wait in line, buisniss is no needed, you get all the waiting for free"
202,Poor,Checkin If you are trying to verify your booking you cannot do it unless you have a up-to-date phone .be cause I had a lot of trouble doing it .in the end I got someone to do for me and thay had trouble to.got it in the end.but you look on another holiday you do not have to do…
203,Poor,Terrible delays. Stealing people's time. 2 hours delay. by the time i get on the plane i would have arrived at my destination with another airline
204,Poor,"The staff members were friendly and there was more leg space than other lower budget airlines. However, the company itself is not very customer friendly. For us we were unable to pay for food and drinks with our bank card."
205,Poor,I took a flight from Italy to Romania and they forced me to pay 60 euros more because my backpack was 5 cm larger than allowed... I understand business is business but this is also a mockery.... would never fly with ryanair ever again
206,Poor,Exhausting flight delayed an hour and a half but put more time on that we are currently standing on a stairs with no information no movement just stuck on a stairs at 11pm waiting. Excruciating...why not leave us sitting if we are just going to be left on a stairway?? Never again
207,Poor,"Priority boarding is a myth, in Luxembourg airport at least. OK, they sort the passengers into priority and non-. The priority passengers have priority into the gate lounge, then the non-priority get into the gate lounge. Then they all get mixed up and you take your chances for…"
208,Poor,I go on ryanair allot but I have to say it is outrageous how unsanitary the plane is and my flight was on 6.30 and it got delayed to nine.their flights are always delayed.
209,Poor,"Only flew with Ryanair on maybe 3 occasions, and every time the flight has been delayed, after there huge profit so far this year, they could at least deliver a spot on service."
210,Poor,"The flight was late and the plane was incredibly untidy (a previous passenger's crisps adorned the floor). On a brighter note, the crew were pleasant enough and the flight was cheap. It would have been nice to not sit in someone else's food though."
211,Poor,Not good airline. The seats are dirty not cleaned. Had to pay over £100 for 10 kg over. Seats are stiff and has no recline or padding. I am absolutely disgusted with this. The only thing that I am pleased with is that the crew are friendly and caring .
212,Poor,"Ryanair almost always starts off late the flight without any reimbursement of course. Their rules are always strict for the client (baggage kilos, late check-in etc) but never for themselves."
213,Poor,Only good thing about Ryanair is that its cheap and the app is user friendly. That is it! I have been flying frequently from Malmo to Zagreb and back. I have expirienced delays 70% of the time. Last flight was overbooked and delayed without notice. Good luck flying Ryanair :)
214,Poor,"Awful service, 2 hour delay and then they preboard and leave you in the jet way for another 30 minutes. They done care as long as they get your money, no apologies nothing."
215,Poor,"Average flight, customer service agent refused to print a pass for me, seemed annoyed to even be asked to do so. He said it was company policy to not to, but after further discussion finally printed one for me. It seems minor but it just came off as can't be bothered to help a customer."
216,Poor,"I went on Ryanair for a holiday, the way there was alright the way back was shocking, Rude staff, not clean, Hard landings. Angry people, horrid, Do NOT fly with this airline"
217,Poor,"Lower fares but planes alwatslaye arriving and departing. Staff average, onboard services average. Disorganised, amateur not very professional."
218,Poor,"We planned a day trip to Santorini. The idea was to maximize the time by flying to the Island in the early morning and depart by the last flight. In both cases, our flights were delayed leading to longer waits at the airport and rescheduling the activities."
219,Poor,"Smallest, cheapest, most uncomfortable flight I ever had. If you are bigger then the average Ethiopian child, you will have a terrible flight for comfort"
220,Poor,"Unhygenic, insects, litter, late flight, long queues waiting on stairs etc, charge extra money for everything, lots of advertising and selling on board"
221,Poor,They made sure if you don't pay for your seat they will make sure they will spilt the family. Otherwise seats are old
222,Poor,We received a message at 6:30 in the evening that we have to get to a city 3.5 hours away for our morning flight back home. We paid 850€ for a taxi and now we really hope to get our money back. Its really funny that they think all Ryanair customers have this much money on their account to spend on a freaking taxi.
223,Poor,"While boarding, the ticket & passport checker guy looked at my passport and asked how old i was, that was ofc acceptable but then after i replied that i was 23, he gave me my passport back and then unnecceseraly commented that i look much younger than 23. Ok, rude????"
224,Poor,Ryanair does not have direct personnel at the Shannon Airport and the people at the checkin counter are limited on their capacity to solve problems and terrified of making decisions.
225,Poor,Feel like I’ve been ripped off for The get go! So sone my booking as last min deal in morning in my phone as had to ring up so so I did that in afternoon as booked hotel then to be told in evening they upped my flights by extra £200 then I had to pay extra £26 just to be seated…
226,Poor,"Ryanair check passengers in and hold them on steps, overcrowded and no seats bad air. Or put them on warm or freezing tarmac. This is done more and more. Regulators should stop the practice"
227,Poor,"The boarding was the the most worse ever, nobody took in account if we had priority or not , people with no priority went in front, and very rood personnel at the boarding gate."
228,Poor,"Poor customer service. If you have a problem, get ready to be played with or chat with a useless bot."
229,Poor,Poor customer service and secretly hidden extra price and cause horrible issues and awfully horrible landings and is the worst airline in the world.
230,Poor,Price of ticket 53 euros. Price for checking in at the counter and not online 62 euros :(. No other comment necessary. Be aware.
231,Poor,The most crap company. Always delayed. Doesn’t matter season or not. They never on time. And never advise you before
232,Poor,"it was terrible!! He kept us on the stairs after checking our tickets for 30 minutes, then on the plane for another hour!! dirt on the floor! very ugly Last time with RyanAir"
233,Poor,"The ryanair planes ALWAYS late. The vienna-rhodes flight was standing about 1,5 hour and late 2hour. Now the rhodes-vienna plane is doing the same."
234,Poor,"Had appr. 20 flights from and to stansted-eindhoven, only 4 have been on time. For me Ryanair is not a reliable airline."
235,Poor,Filthy! Seat had hairs all over it and there were sticky sweets left on the floor and between the seats. The tray was sticky where a drink had been spilt and had run down the seat in front. The window was dirty with mucky finger prints. My luggage bag was dirty after having to stow it under the seat.
236,Poor,"Not only 1 1/2 hours late, but the barrage of shouty announcements throughout the flight made the whole experience unnecessarily unpleasant. Cheap (ish) but not cheerful."
237,Poor,"Simply terrible. Late, couldnt care less attitude by cabin crew, shouting match with ground crew, checkin was a disgrace. I dont understand how they can stay in business."
238,Poor,"They don t care about people, they put you in a full bus waiting in front of the airplane after you already waited 40 min at the gate for the bus to come"
239,Poor,Always thought it was a good way to travel. I’m only 13 stone and can’t fit in the new type aircraft seats. They are only fit for children. Shame they let that happen
240,Poor,First time ever in over 40 years of flying I've been told I couldn't put my jacket in the overhead locker - they are reserved for (prepaid) luggage. Crew very unfriendly and not very pleasant at all. Won't be flying with them again.
241,Poor,That Pilot buttered the bread on that landing. Some girl legit (I’m not kidding) screamed. The flight attendants were mean. Boarding was absolute Chaos. The legroom was ok. I’ve never really had a worse experience other than on my air Koryo flight.
242,Poor,"A week old plane and the seat trays were dirty and there were drink stains on the carpet. The plane was the 737 Max that Ryanair are not calling them that name by and have to be the most uncomfortable seats I have ever travelled in. I am only 5.10""and my knees were tight to the seat in front and had to make sure I kept my elbows tucked in as I was in the aisle seat."
243,Poor,"After lots of bullc.... about missing paper work, turns out they lied, it was technically error. We needed to go back to terminal and wait. Ok, it happens. Then we got told there would be compensation voucher for eat and drink since flight delayed more than 3 hours. Noone Came for 2 hours, we had to search for ryanair employee. Then.... Voucher for 35 nok. 35!! Is this a joke? The voucher not Even covered 0,5l water bottle..."
244,Poor,"We're waiting for 2 months for a refund for a delayed flight, and nobody replies to our messages on several channels.
The cabin crew was impatient and rude"
245,Poor,Paid for cabin bag but people who had not paid for cabin bag bringing rucksacks and and cabin bags onboard
246,Poor,I was bitten on the backs of my legs during the flight by what must have been fleas in the seat or the carpet. With the fast turnround times I suppose there is no time for a proper vacuum or spray.
247,Poor,"Departure almost on time, only 30min late or so. Boarding went smoothly. Unfortunately it did not look that the plane was cleaned before the flight."
248,Poor,I was glad that I paid more for extra legroom as my husband is tall. Sad that their idea of extra legroom is none at all.
249,Poor,"We had a beautiful, very relaxing flight with Ryanair and were so glad we arrived safely in Lanzarote. But we were really annoyed that paid for a bus transfer to our accommodation when it Came up as an option while we were booking our flights from Dublin to Lanzarote. Nobody showed up for us and we had to pay for a taxi. Why ask us to pay for transfer from the airport and not show up for us.??"
250,Poor,"People Clapping? Medal? Melts... The seats were not that comfortable, upon arrival i had to pay an extra £30.00 for my bag, wish this was stated on my flight in the first place."
251,Terrible,"The check in process was not working on the app, the website, the phone or the computer. I chat with Ryanair the day before the flight they said it would be solved . They had no solution at the airport, they charged me and insulted me, they just ignored the problem and obliged me to pay or they would cancel the flight. Last time with these people now I will flight with other airlines"
252,Terrible,Stuck on flight as it was grounded and they refused to let us off for fresh air for 3 hours with no food and water
253,Terrible,Unless your under 36 inch wait don't expect to fasten your seat belt. Paid for extra leg room both ways on the way out I was given seat belt extension but on the way back it was not legal so we had to switch seats.
254,Terrible,The worst f****** flyight in my whole life....we have to buy watter 5e ! It was terrible never again with rynair!!!!!!!
255,Terrible,"Expensive tickets, poor customer support.
No interest in clients opinions. There were families with kids sleeping on the airport floor and no communication from Ryanair"
256,Terrible,More than an hour late going and coming. Very little and often misleading information provided. Untidy cabin on top of everything.
257,Terrible,"Seat where I should seat 23F - floor, seat in front of me and wall was covered with vomit. No one from crew didn't take care of this situation."
258,Terrible,"The lady who checked out passport and flight told us that we couldn’t bring our hot drink on the plane. She was very rude. The drink was basically full and when I went into the plane, the attendants said we could bring our drink. Very disappointed."
259,Terrible,Very unpleasant Spanish check-in staff at the airport. The woman harassed people unreasonably and was rude . I was my first and last time in Lanzarote
260,Terrible,"WORST AIRLINE ON THE PLANET. EXPENSIVE, CRAP. AVOID THIS AIRLINE AT ALL COST. DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FAMILY MEMBERS SO YOU HAVE TO BUY SEATS"
261,Terrible,"They cancelled my flight and didn't refund me. NEVER AGAIN. They offer the worst costumer support. Never helped me with anything, almost lost my mind trying to deal with them."
262,Terrible,"It fits the metal cage with plenty space around yet they wanted to charge me today on flight to glasgow from Lanzarote!!! Lack of ethics, not humane, Ryanair is worst flight company eveeer!!!!!!"
263,Terrible,Delayed coming and going Ryanair farming out flight to another foreign budget airline - shocking service and first and last time with an incompetent airline- my advice avoid at all costs
264,Terrible,"Ryanair is the worst Airline on the planet. They lie, cheat, and are generally the lowest form of human life from the top down."
265,Terrible,"It was my first time I had traveled with Ryanair .. it will be last time,, I will never travel with them again… it is horrible .."
266,Terrible,"If the airplane ticked costed 1 dollar, it wouldn't be worth the degradation and the horrible experience we had. This company stand's for everything I'm against for. Never again!"
267,Terrible,"Horrendous!! Never use this airline if you can avoid it. Staff incredibly unpleasant, the whole experience is a con to try and ensure the company gets more money. Worst company on planet earth!"
268,Terrible,"Will never fly this piece of garbage airline again. Delays, delays, delays, every single one of their flights was delayed."
269,Terrible,Used my card details to book someone else's flight and application swapped my details with passenger details. Now Ryanair wants me to pay £115 for name change. Passenger details were 100% correct in the first place. Thats a scam. Avoid them!
270,Terrible,The airline won’t let you check in online and require you to cue to collect your boarding pass. Unless of course you want to pay an additional amount to check in online.
271,Terrible,"Worst experience , no proper guidance or help on airport, just charging money for checking in for baggage on airport,"
272,Terrible,Now force you to queue at airport to print ticket unless you pay extra to buy a seat. No mobile boarding passes without. A new low!
273,Terrible,Now force you to queue at airport to print ticket unless you pay extra to buy a seat. No mobile boarding passes without. A new low!
274,Terrible,"Ryanair is unacceptable! I made a booking for an international flight and they don't issue an invoice or a receipt for the company i am working, although their booking system let me choose if i want an invoice for an international flight. The customer service is rude and they simply don't care. Never book a flight with Ryanair again!!!!"
275,Terrible,"Flight delayed, no apologies and ended up flying to a different airline (stanstead). A new low Avoid, not worth it."
276,Terrible,"The worst company I have tried before. You can sell a ticket for Dusseldorf but actually That stop in Weeze, an airport 70 km from Dusseldorf city. They should be more clear about the final destination"
277,Terrible,After horrible experience I won't take them even for free. They are denying each other. Cost me extra 233 Euros
278,Terrible,hidden fees. fees are not clearly stated so they can charge passengers. They mislead us by this. bad customer service.
279,Terrible,Airport Check-in fee of 55 € was hidden! Not explicitly mentioned like other fees while booking!! You are misleading people. We are sooooo disappointed!!
280,Terrible,Worst experience ever. You have to pay to sit together on the plan. Then the stewards were trying to charge me for a small bag on the plane. Even though it was the size advertised as free. Terrible experience from stary to finish and i will never use them again. AVOID IF POSSIBLE
281,Terrible,"So many hidden fees, just not worth it. €55 just to check in to the flight, what a joke. All other airlines are free. Will not be travelling with Ryanair again"
282,Terrible,Worst air company in the world. Never buy tickets by them. Flight has been cancelled and they don't want to refund money back.
283,Terrible,Worst staff at Bergamo airport they purposefully make to wait for checkin until it closes in the system incase of issues with checkin and force you pay the airport fee.
284,Terrible,"Very unethical, shady hidden fees at every corner. I’m surprised they didn’t have a secret “breathing air” fee. And they don’t tell you ahead of time. They don’t let you check in very far ahead of time. And they also don’t take cash. They nearly got me stranded overseas. Customer service was HORRIBLE! Worst airline ever; I’ll never use this airline again."
285,Terrible,"This blonde women working for ryan air made me pay $80 to check in because the app didn’t work. Most rude worker ever, I hope she had Been fired. Would never fly ryan air again, biggest joke."
286,Terrible,"Disgusting cleanliness (one of the many pictures attached) in the aircraft. Very unprofessional. After having accepted everyone with big luggages, pillows and three bags each, my luggage wasn't accepted for the size of the wheels. When I complained about it, the steward at the desk started to shout using swearing words. Embarrassing. The most disgusting company ever."
287,Terrible,"They're thieves. They took €66 from us because we couldn't pay online due to their website not working. And we didn't know that we had to pay to register in person. This has happened to several people. Give us our money back, you scammers!"
288,Terrible,"The airline is a complete farce, systems that don’t work and then want to charge you for their incompetence. They don’t even look after their own flights and swissport are just as incompetent if not worse."
289,Terrible,"Horrible and unfriendly. They cancelled my flight two days in advance and didn't care at all about how I would reach my final destination. They only thing they said was that there were no suitable Ryanair flights in the next four days. I could get my 39 Euros flight refunded, which doesn't help much, of course... Never again with Ryanair!"
290,Terrible,Absolute horrible experience. Their app was down so wouldn’t let you check in and regardless of this they charged you extortionate amounts to check in. Already purchased cabin baggage but they still charged me again! The staff were hopeless as they don’t know what’s going on themselves and some were so rude but tbf not their fault they work for a sh*tty airline. Terrible experience never again.
291,Terrible,"We had to wait in Rinas tirana Airport for 1 hours in side the plane and no Air conditioning at all
I asked for glass of water for my medication and I was refused"
292,Terrible,Ryan air is a horrible airline. Never again. They “cheap rates” is a big lie and you still won’t get value for your money.
293,Terrible,Left stranded in a foreign Country after they cancelled our flight. They are now refusing to refund the flights. Do not trust.
294,Terrible,VERY OLD AIRPLANE WITH NARROW AND OLD AND DIRTY SEATS THE SEATS WERE FOR HALF THE SURFACE OF A NORMAL POSTURE
295,Terrible,"I had to pay for my bag, which I have already paid for. When I purchased the ticket I bought 1 small bag and 1 hand luggage. From Malta to Sofia no issues but back to Malta they told me I have to pay once again. Please note I purchased two way ticket with both luggage."
296,Terrible,"Another late departure, why do you recommend me to come here 2h before flught if on time of departure I'm still in a queue in airpot? I could spend 2h more productive than waiting you to sort out a flight... Useless, your cheap prices not exuses you for this level of service..."
297,Terrible,"This airline is cheap, but they will find ways to charge fees every step of the way during your travel when you cannot refuse to pay. They are rude and sneaky and will take complete advantage of you. I would avoid using Ryanair and gladly pay a higher price fare with a more professional airline. At least that way I know exactly how much the trip will really cost."
298,Terrible,"Don't have priority by right for pregnants is a very bad service, and your employees should be more polite cause other company's have priority without pay for it is a woman's right poor service"
299,Terrible,Paid for a 10kg cabin bag online arrived at gate charged me 46 euro saying I should have checked in at gate rip off or what pointed out a tiny print on bottom of ticket reporting to consumer complaints it was a carry on bag now they say priority only are allowed overhead carry on
300,Terrible,Appalling...this company should go bankrupt. This flight was missed due to it being a connection and we were ushered out from transfer to go back through security. Next flights were overbooked and couldn't get on so returned back to where the 1st flight came from.
